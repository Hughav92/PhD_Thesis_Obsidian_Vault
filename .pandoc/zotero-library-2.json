  {"id":"ahnDesigningContextReaching2019","abstract":"Researchers and developers of learning analytics (LA) systems are increasingly adopting human-centred design (HCD) approaches, with growing need to understand how to apply design practice in different educational settings. In this paper, we present a design narrative of our experience developing dashboards to support middle school mathematics teachers’ pedagogical practices, in a multi-university, multi-school district, improvement science initiative in the United States. Through documentation of our design experience, we offer ways to adapt common HCD methods — contextual design and design tensions — when developing visual analytics systems for educators. We also illuminate how adopting these design methods within the context of improvement science and research–practice partnerships fundamentally influences the design choices we make and the focal questions we undertake. The results of this design process flow naturally from the appropriation and repurposing of tools by district partners and directly inform improvement goals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahn","given":"June"},{"family":"Campos","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Hays","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Digiacomo","given":"Daniela"}],"citation-key":"ahnDesigningContextReaching2019","container-title":"Journal of Learning Analytics","DOI":"10.18608/jla.2019.62.5","ISSN":"1929-7750","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,22]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2019 Journal of Learning Analytics","number":"2","page":"70-85","source":"learning-analytics.info","title":"Designing in Context: Reaching Beyond Usability in Learning Analytics Dashboard Design","title-short":"Designing in Context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/6344","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"alhadadVisualizingDataSupport2018","abstract":"Understanding human judgement and decision making during visual inspection of data is of both practical and theoretical interest. While visualizing data is a commonly employed mechanism to support complex cognitive processes such as inference, judgement, and decision making, the process of supporting and scaffolding cognition through effective design is less well understood. Applying insights from cognitive psychology and visualization science, this paper critically discusses the role of human factors — visual attention, perception, judgement, and decision making — toward informing methodological choices when visualizing data. The value of visualizing data is discussed in two key domains: 1) visualizing data as a means of communication; and 2) visualizing data as research methodology. The first applies cognitive science principles and research evidence to inform data visualization design for communication. The second applies data- and cognitive-science to deepen our understanding of data, of its uncertainty, and of analysis when making inferences. The evidence for human capacity limitations — attention and cognition — are discussed in the context of data visualizations to support inference-making in both domains, and are followed by recommendations. Finally, how learning analytics can further research on understanding the role data visualizations can play in supporting complex cognition is proposed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Alhadad","given":"Sakinah S.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) research to assess i) the available evidence of impact on learning outcomes in real-world contexts and ii) explore the extent to which ethical considerations are addressed. A few recent literature reviews argue for the promising value of multimodal data in learning analytics research. However, our understanding of the challenges associated with MMLA research from real-world teaching and learning environments is limited. To address this gap, this paper provides an overview of the evidence of impact and ethical considerations stemming from an analysis of the relevant MMLA research published in the last decade. The search of the literature resulted in 663 papers, of which 100 were included in the final synthesis. The results show that the evidence of real-world impact on learning outcomes is weak, and ethical aspects of MMLA work are rarely addressed. We discuss our results through the lenses of two theoretical frameworks for evidence of impact types and ethical dimensions of MMLA. We conclude that for MMLA to stay relevant and become part of mainstream education, future research should directly address the gaps identified in this review.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Alwahaby","given":"Haifa"},{"family":"Cukurova","given":"Mutlu"},{"family":"Papamitsiou","given":"Zacharoula"},{"family":"Giannakos","given":"Michail"}],"citation-key":"alwahabyEvidenceImpactEthical2021","DOI":"10.35542/osf.io/sd23y","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,22]]},"language":"en-us","publisher":"EdArXiv","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"The evidence of impact and ethical considerations of Multimodal Learning Analytics: A Systematic Literature Review","title-short":"The evidence of impact and ethical considerations of Multimodal Learning Analytics","type":"article","URL":"https://edarxiv.org/sd23y/"},
  {"id":"amonDyadicCoordinationMultimodal2019","abstract":"We hypothesize that effective collaboration is facilitated when individuals and environmental components form a synergy where they work together and regulate one another to produce stable patterns of behavior, or regularity, as well as adaptively reorganize to form new behaviors, or irregularity. We tested this hypothesis in a study with 32 triads who collaboratively solved a challenging visual computer programming task for 20 min following an introductory warm-up phase. Multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis was used to examine fine-grained (i.e., every 10 s) collective patterns of regularity across team members' speech rate, body movement, and team interaction with the shared user interface. We found that teams exhibited significant patterns of regularity as compared to shuffled baselines, but there were no systematic trends in regularity across time. We also found that periods of regularity were associated with a reduction in overall behavior. Notably, the production of irregular behavior predicted expert-coded metrics of collaborative activity, such as teams' ability to construct shared knowledge and effectively negotiate and coordinate execution of solutions, net of overall behavioral production and behavioral self-similarity. Our findings support the theory that groups can interact to form interpersonal synergies and indicate that information about system-level dynamics is a viable way to understand and predict effective collaborative processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Amon","given":"Mary Jean"},{"family":"Vrzakova","given":"Hana"},{"family":"D'Mello","given":"Sidney K."}],"citation-key":"amonDyadicCoordinationMultimodal2019","container-title":"Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1111/cogs.12787","ISSN":"1551-6709","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 Cognitive Science Society, Inc","page":"e12787","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Beyond Dyadic Coordination: Multimodal Behavioral Irregularity in Triads Predicts Facets of Collaborative Problem Solving","title-short":"Beyond Dyadic Coordination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cogs.12787","volume":"43"},

Having access to a partner's referential gaze behavior has been shown to be particularly important in achieving collaborative outcomes, but the process in which people's gaze behaviors unfold over the course of an interaction and become tightly coordinated is not well understood. In this paper, we present work to develop a deeper and more nuanced understanding of coordinated referential gaze in collaborating dyads. We recruited 13 dyads to participate in a collaborative sandwich-making task and used dual mobile eye tracking to synchronously record each participant's gaze behavior. We used a relatively new analysis technique—epistemic network analysis—to jointly model the gaze behaviors of both conversational participants. In this analysis, network nodes represent gaze targets for each participant, and edge strengths convey the likelihood of simultaneous gaze to the connected target nodes during a given time-slice. We divided collaborative task sequences into discrete phases to examine how the networks of shared gaze evolved over longer time windows. We conducted three separate analyses of the data to reveal (1) properties and patterns of how gaze coordination unfolds throughout an interaction sequence, (2) optimal time lags of gaze alignment within a dyad at different phases of the interaction, and (3) differences in gaze coordination patterns for interaction sequences that lead to breakdowns and repairs.

  {"id":"aoyamalawrenceBeingInsyncMultimodal2022","abstract":"Collaborative learners share an experience when focusing on a task together and coevally influence each other’s emotions and motivations. Continuous emotional synchronization relates to how learners co-regulate their cognitive resources, especially regarding their joint attention and transactive discourse. “Being in-sync” then refers to multiple emotional and cognitive group states and processes, raising the question: to what extent and when is being in-sync beneficial and when is it not? In this article, we propose a framework of multi-modal learning analytics addressing synchronization of collaborative learners across emotional and cognitive dimensions and different modalities. To exemplify this framework and approach the question of how emotions and cognitions intertwine in collaborative learning, we present contrasting cases of learners in a tabletop environment that have or have not been instructed to coordinate their gaze. Qualitative analysis of multimodal data incorporating eye-tracking and electrodermal sensors shows that gaze instruction facilitated being emotionally, cognitively, and behaviorally “in-sync” during the peer collaboration. Identifying and analyzing moments of shared emotional shifts shows how learners are establishing shared understanding regarding both the learning task as well as the relationship among them when they are emotionally “in-sync.” Copyright © 2022 Aoyama Lawrence and Weinberger.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Aoyama Lawrence","given":"L."},{"family":"Weinberger","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"aoyamalawrenceBeingInsyncMultimodal2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Education","container-title-short":"Front.

Students’ cognitive–affective states are studied using different populations (Philippines, USA), different methods (quantitative field observation, self-report), and different types of learning environments (dialogue tutor, problem-solving game, and problem-solving-based Intelligent Tutoring System). By varying the studies along these multiple factors, we can have greater confidence that findings which generalize across studies are robust. The incidence, persistence, and impact of boredom, frustration, confusion, engaged concentration, delight, and surprise were compared. We found that boredom was very persistent across learning environments and was associated with poorer learning and problem behaviors, such as gaming the system. Despite prior hypothesis to the contrary, frustration was less persistent, less associated with poorer learning, and did not appear to be an antecedent to gaming the system. Confusion and engaged concentration were the most common states within all three learning environments. Experiences of delight and surprise were rare. These findings suggest that significant effort should be put into detecting and responding to boredom and confusion, with a particular emphasis on developing pedagogical interventions to disrupt the “vicious cycles” which occur when a student becomes bored and remains bored for long periods of time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Ryan S.

We discuss these findings in terms of the design and ethical issues that it raises, and define an agenda for future work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Balaam","given":"Madeline"},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Geraldine"},{"family":"Good","given":"Judith"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"balaamEnhancingInteractionalSynchrony2011","collection-title":"CHI '11","container-title":"Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10/dc386j","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-0228-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5,7]]},"page":"867–876","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Enhancing interactional synchrony with an ambient display","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/1978942.1979070"},

This systematic literature review maps the current state of implementation of LA to improve feedback practices in technology-mediated learning environments in higher education. We used strict inclusion criteria to select relevant studies that have investigated the role of LA on feedback practices. To identify common features of LA for feedback studies, we coded relevant publications using an analytical framework that identifies four key dimensions of LA systems: what (types of data), how (analytic methods), why (objectives), and how educators and students are served by LA (stakeholders). Based on findings, we propose a conceptual framework that can guide the implementation of LA for feedback systems and also suggest future empirical research in this area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Banihashem","given":"Seyyed Kazem"},{"family":"Noroozi","given":"Omid"},{"family":"Ginkel","given":"Stan","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"P.Macfadyen","given":"Leah"},{"family":"Biemans","given":"Harm J.

  {"id":"barmakiDeepNeuralNetworks2020","abstract":"Automatic assessment and evaluation of team performance during collaborative tasks is key to the research on learning analytics and computer-supported cooperative work. There is growing interest in the use of gaze-oriented cues for evaluating the collaboration and cooperativeness of teams. However, collecting gaze data using eye-trackers is not always feasible due to time and cost constraints. In this paper, we introduce an automated team assessment tool based on gaze points and joint visual attention (JVA) information drawn from computer vision solutions. We evaluated team collaborations in an undergraduate anatomy learning activity (N = 60, 30 teams) as a test user study. The results indicate that higher JVA was positively associated with student learning outcomes (r(30) = 0.50, p < 0.005). Moreover, teams who participated in two experimental groups and used interactive 3D anatomy models, had higher JVA (F(1,28) = 6.65, p < 0.05) and better knowledge retention (F(1,28) = 7.56, p < 0.05) than those in the control group. Also, no significant difference was observed based on JVA for different gender compositions of teams. The findings from this work have implications in learning sciences and collaborative computing by providing a novel joint attention-based measure to objectively evaluate team collaboration dynamics. \nImplications for practice or policy: \n \nStudent learning outcomes can be improved by receiving constructive feedback about team performances using our gaze-based collaborative learning method. \nUnderrepresented and underserved minorities of science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines can be engaged in more collaborative problem-solving and team-based learning activities since our method offers a broader reach by automating collaboration assessment process. \nCourse leaders can assess the quality of attention and engagement among students and can monitor or assist larger numbers of students simultaneously.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Barmaki","given":"Roghayeh"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Zhang"}],"citation-key":"barmakiDeepNeuralNetworks2020","container-title":"Australasian Journal of Educational Technology","container-title-short":"AJET","DOI":"10.14742/ajet.6436","ISSN":"1449-5554, 1449-3098","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"53-71","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Deep neural networks for collaborative learning analytics: Evaluating team collaborations using student gaze point prediction: Evaluating team collaborations using students’ gaze point prediction","title-short":"Deep neural networks for collaborative learning analytics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ajet.org.au/index.php/AJET/article/view/6436","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"barronWhenSmartGroups2003","abstract":"In this study I investigated how collaborative interactions influence problem-solving outcomes. Conversations of twelve 6th-grade triads were analyzed utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. Neither prior achievement of group members nor the generation of correct ideas for solution could account for between-triad differences in problem-solving outcomes. Instead, both characteristics of proposals and partner responsiveness were important correlates of the uptake and documentation of correct ideas by the group. Less successful groups ignored or rejected correct proposals, whereas more successful groups discussed or accepted them. Conversations in less successful groups were relatively incoherent as measured by the extent that proposals for solutions in these groups were connected with preceding discussions. Performance differences observed in triads extended to subsequent problem-solving sessions during which all students solved the same kinds of problems independently. These findings suggest that the quality of interaction had implications for learning. Case study descriptions illustrate the interweaving of social and cognitive factors involved in establishing a joint problem-solving space. A dual-space model of what collaboration requires of participants is described to clarify how the content of the problem and the relational context are interdependent aspects of the collaborative situation. How participants manage these interacting spaces is critical to the outcome of their work and helps account for variability in collaborative outcomes. Directions for future research that may help teachers, students, and designers of educational environments learn to see and foster productive interactional practices are proposed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Barron","given":"Brigid"}],"citation-key":"barronWhenSmartGroups2003","container-title":"Journal of the Learning Sciences","DOI":"10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_1","ISSN":"1050-8406","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",7,1]]},"page":"307-359","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"When Smart Groups Fail","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_1","volume":"12"},

In this paper we begin to develop a social semiotic framework to account for transcripts as artefacts, treating them as empirical material through which transcription as a social, meaning making practice can be reconstructed. We look at some multimodal transcripts produced in conversation analysis, discourse analysis, social semiotics and micro‐ethnography, drawing attention to the meaning‐making principles applied by the transcribers.

  {"id":"bhattCapturingSociomaterialityDigital2014","abstract":"This paper discusses a method of collecting and analysing multimodal data during classroom-based digital literacy research. Drawing on reflections from two studies, the authors discuss theoretical and methodological implications encountered in the collection, transcription and presentation of such data. Following an ethnomethodological framework that co-develops theory and methodology, the studies capture digital literacy activities as real-time screen recordings, with embedded video recordings of participants’ movements and vocalisations around the tasks during writing. The result is a multimodal rendition of digital literacy events on- and off-screen, allowing linguistic and multimodal transcriptions to capture the complexity of the data in a format amenable to analysis. Acquiring such data allowed for the development of detailed analyses of digital literacy events in the classroom, including interaction that would otherwise have escaped standard ethnography and video analysis, through sensibilities that approach social and material items without a priori hierarchies. This leads us to a ‘performative’ notion of digital literacies and an analytic methodology that is useful for researchers paying greater attention to the sociomaterial assemblages in which digital literacy events unfold.Keywords: digital literacies; multimodality; video analysis; screen capture; literacy studies; actor-network theory(Published: 31 January 2014)Citation: Research in Learning Technology 2014, 21: 21281 - http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/rlt.v21.21281","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhatt","given":"Ibrar"},{"family":"De Roock","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"bhattCapturingSociomaterialityDigital2014","container-title":"Research in Learning Technology","container-title-short":"Research in Learning Technology","DOI":"10.3402/rlt.v21.21281","ISSN":"2156-7077, 2156-7069","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,31]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Capturing the sociomateriality of digital literacy events","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journal.alt.ac.uk/index.php/rlt/article/view/1427","volume":"21"},

We present several examples of this work and its educational application.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Blikstein","given":"Paulo"},{"family":"Worsley","given":"Marcelo"}],"citation-key":"bliksteinMultimodalLearningAnalytics2016","container-title":"Journal of Learning Analytics","DOI":"10/ggkm7c","ISSN":"1929-7750","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2016 Journal of Learning Analytics","number":"2","page":"220-238","source":"www.learning-analytics.info","title":"Multimodal Learning Analytics and Education Data Mining: using computational technologies to measure complex learning tasks","title-short":"Multimodal Learning Analytics and Education Data Mining","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/4383","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"brohinskyTrajectoriesEpistemicNetwork2021","abstract":"While quantitative ethnographers have used epistemic network analysis (ENA) to model trajectories that show change in network structure over time, visualizing trajectory models in a way that facilitates accurate interpretation has been a significant challenge. As a result, ENA has predominantly been used to construct aggregate models, which can obscure key differences in how network structures change over time. This study reports on the development and testing of a new approach to visualizing ENA trajectories. It documents the challenges associated with visualizing ENA trajectory models, the features constructed to address those challenges, and the design decisions that aid in the interpretation of trajectory models. To test this approach, we compare ENA trajectory models with aggregate models using a dataset with previously published results and known temporal features. This comparison focuses on interpretability and consistency with prior qualitative analysis, and we show that ENA trajectories are able to represent information unavailable in aggregate models and facilitate interpretations consistent with qualitative findings. This suggests that this approach to ENA trajectories is an effective tool for representing change in network structure over time.","author":[{"family":"Brohinsky","given":"Jais"},{"family":"Marquart","given":"Cody"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Junting"},{"family":"Ruis","given":"A.

  {"id":"brucknerEpistemicNetworkAnalyses2020","abstract":"Learning to solve graph tasks is one of the key prerequisites of acquiring domain-specific knowledge in most study domains. Analyses of graph understanding often use eye-tracking and focus on analyzing how much time students spend gazing at particular areas of a graph—Areas of Interest (AOIs). To gain a deeper insight into students’ task-solving process, we argue that the gaze shifts between students’ fixations on different AOIs (so-termed transitions) also need to be included in holistic analyses of graph understanding that consider the importance of transitions for the task-solving process. Thus, we introduced Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) as a novel approach to analyze eye-tracking data of 23 university students who solved eight multiple-choice graph tasks in physics and economics. ENA is a method for quantifying, visualizing, and interpreting network data allowing a weighted analysis of the gaze patterns of both correct and incorrect graph task solvers considering the interrelations between fixations and transitions. After an analysis of the differences in the number of fixations and the number of single transitions between correct and incorrect solvers, we conducted an ENA for each task. We demonstrate that an isolated analysis of fixations and transitions provides only a limited insight into graph solving behavior. In contrast, ENA identifies differences between the gaze patterns of students who solved the graph tasks correctly and incorrectly across the multiple graph tasks. For instance, incorrect solvers shifted their gaze from the graph to the x-axis and from the question to the graph comparatively more often than correct solvers. The results indicate that incorrect solvers often have problems transferring textual information into graphical information and rely more on partly irrelevant parts of a graph. Finally, we discuss how the findings can be used to design experimental studies and for innovative instructional procedures in higher education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Brückner","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Drachsler","given":"Hendrik"}],"citation-key":"brucknerEpistemicNetworkAnalyses2020","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s20236908","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"23","page":"6908","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Epistemic Network Analyses of Economics Students’ Graph Understanding: An Eye-Tracking Study","title-short":"Epistemic Network Analyses of Economics Students’ Graph Understanding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/23/6908","volume":"20"},

We define two requirements that extend the QE concept in order to operationalise it such a design process, namely, the use of co-design methodologies, and the availability of automated analytics workflow to close the feedback loop. We introduce the Multimodal Matrix as a data modelling approach that can integrate theoretical concepts about teamwork with contextual insights about specific work practices, enabling the analyst to map between higher order codes and low-level sensor data, with the option add the results of manually performed analyses. This is implemented in software as a workflow for rapid data modelling, analysis and interactive visualisation, demonstrated in the context of nursing teamwork simulations.

  {"id":"bugdenOnlineCollaborationPedagogical2018","abstract":"Legal education is in a period of rapid development driven by changing industry demands and developing technologies. This paper will describe an innovative pilot study which utilises new technologies to provide an alternative mode of teaching and learning to meet growing industry demands for graduates who are technologically savvy and have strong communication and collaboration skills. The pilot study redesigns a law unit combining a more traditional approach with an approach in which online collaboration is critical to student learning as a teaching and assessment tool. After completing an online collaborative activity as part of their assessment for the unit, students completed an online survey to identify their perspectives of the online collaborative experience.

Content-free tasks were developed to emphasise the enhancement of inductive and deductive thinking skills. Content-dependent tasks allow students to draw on knowledge gained through traditional learning areas or subjects within the curriculum. The collaborative problem solving framework emphasises communication for the purpose of information gathering, identification of available and required information, identification and analysis of patterns in the data, formulation of contingencies or rules, generalisation of rules, and test hypotheses.

Unfortunately, there is a natural correlation between the complexity of the data and the complexity of the tools to study them. An adverse effect of complicated tools is that analytical goals are more difficult to reach. Therefore, it makes sense to consider methods that guide or assist users in the visual analysis process. Several such methods already exist in the literature, yet we are lacking a general model that facilitates in-depth reasoning about guidance. We establish such a model by extending van Wijk's model of visualization with the fundamental components of guidance. Guidance is defined as a process that gradually narrows the gap that hinders effective continuation of the data analysis. We describe diverse inputs based on which guidance can be generated and discuss different degrees of guidance and means to incorporate guidance into VA tools. We use existing guidance approaches from the literature to illustrate the various aspects of our model. As a conclusion, we identify research challenges and suggest directions for future studies. With our work we take a necessary step to pave the way to a systematic development of guidance techniques that effectively support users in the context of VA.","author":[{"family":"Ceneda","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Gschwandtner","given":"Theresia"},{"family":"May","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Miksch","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Schulz","given":"Hans-Jörg"},{"family":"Streit","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Tominski","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"cenedaCharacterizingGuidanceVisual2017","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","DOI":"10/f92d6c","ISSN":"1941-0506","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1]]},"page":"111-120","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Characterizing Guidance in Visual Analytics","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

Although nurses are the largest healthcare workforce, are present 24-hours a day, and engage in many physically demanding tasks, nurses’ occupational physical activity levels are poorly understood.\nObjectives\nThe aim of this systematic review was to examine nurses’ occupational physical activity levels, and explore how nurses accumulate their physical activity during a shift.\nDesign\nThis narrative systematic review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Statement.\nData sources\nEBSCOHost (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Age Line, Academic Search Complete, Global Health, Health Business Centre, Health Policy Reference Centre, Health Source (Consumer and Nursing/Academic Edition) and SPORTDiscus), Embase, Informit, ProQuest Health and Medical, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science databases.\nReview methods\nA systematic search of seven databases were completed to locate peer-reviewed journal articles documenting nurses’ occupational physical activity levels from January 1990. Papers were included if they were original research papers; measured physical activity objectively and/or subjectively; reported nurses’ occupational physical activity; and were published in English. Articles were excluded if nurses’ data were not reported separately from other professional groups. Two researchers independently screened the articles, extracted data, and undertook the methodological quality assessments.\nResults\nFifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Nursing work predominantly comprised of light-intensity physical activity. In nine studies how nurses’ accumulated occupational physical activity were documented and showed that the majority of a nurses’ shift was spent standing or walking whilst completing direct patient care tasks. However, the definition of the nursing populations studied were often poorly reported, and few researchers reported the validity and the reliability of the measurement tools used.\nConclusions\nNurses’ occupational physical activity levels largely consist of light-intensity physical activity interspersed with moderate-intensity tasks. It is not known whether physical activity during one shift affects the activity levels in the following shift. This systematic review is the first step towards understanding the physical demands of nursing work, and how nurses’ physical activity may impact workplace wellbeing and patient safety.\nLimitations\nA meta-analysis was not possible due to the variability in how physical activity outcomes were presented. Several studies had heart rate outcomes that were converted, where possible, by the authors into physical activity outcomes.\nRegistration\nThis systematic review is registered with PROSPERO","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Chappel","given":"Stephanie E."},{"family":"Verswijveren","given":"Simone J.

  {"id":"chejaraCoTrackToolTracking2020","abstract":"Collocated collaboration in blended settings involves the usage of technology in addition to face-to-face interactions among participants (Martinez-Maldonado et al., 2017), enabling interactions across physical and digital spaces. LA solutions often rely only on interactions captured in the digital space, offering a partial picture of the learning behavior (Pardo & Delgado Kloos, 2011). Aiming to overcome these limitations, CoTrack-has been developed to offer teachers more holistic information about student's collaboration behavior across physical and digital spaces. CoTrack is based on Raspberry Pi and contains two components for data collection purposes: one for tracking students' digital activity in a real-time collaborative editor (Etherpad), and another for collecting privacy-preserving audio data (it only collects the sounds' direction of arrival, DOA). NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used for handling the time synchronization among the data collected from multiple students' groups, and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is used for transmitting audio DOA data to a server in real-time. The data collected is then analyzed to build an interaction network that shows \"who talks to whom\" relationship among students. It was also analyzed to obtain statistics about speaking time and writing activities. Finally, we developed an interactive dashboard for teachers to visualize the data. These features are shown for the entire duration of the collaboration activity and also allow the teacher to change the visualization for different time-frames (e.g. 30 sec, 60 sec, 5 min, etc). CoTrack has been used in an authentic classroom settings involving 1 teacher, 2 researchers and 9 students arranged in groups of 3. We faced the data quality issues because of the classroom noise and students' movement. However, according to the teacher, CoTrack could be helpful for assessing collaborative activities.

Researchers have proposed the automation of this process by estimation into few categories (e.g., high vs. low collaboration). However, such categorical estimation lacks in depth and actionability, which can be critical for practitioners. We present a case study that evaluates the feasibility of quantifying collaboration quality and its multiple sub-dimensions (e.g., collaboration ﬂow) in an authentic classroom setting. We collected multimodal data (audio and logs) from two groups collaborating face-to-face and in a collaborative writing task. The paper describes our exploration of diﬀerent machine learning models and compares their performance with that of human coders, in the task of estimating collaboration quality along a continuum. Our results show that it is feasible to quantitatively estimate collaboration quality and its sub-dimensions, even from simple features of audio and log data, using machine learning. For instance, our support vector regression model covered approximately 50% of the performance gap between randomness and human-level performance. These ﬁndings open possibilities for in-depth automated quantiﬁcation of collaboration quality, and the use of more advanced features and algorithms to get their performance closer to that of human coders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Chejara","given":"Pankaj"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Luis P."},{"family":"Ruiz-Calleja","given":"Adolfo"},{"family":"Rodríguez-Triana","given":"María Jesús"},{"family":"Shankar","given":"Shashi Kant"},{"family":"Kasepalu","given":"Reet"}],"citation-key":"chejaraQuantifyingCollaborationQuality2020","container-title":"Collaboration Technologies and Social Computing","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-58157-2_11","editor":[{"family":"Nolte","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Alvarez","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Hishiyama","given":"Reiko"},{"family":"Chounta","given":"Irene-Angelica"},{"family":"Rodríguez-Triana","given":"María Jesús"},{"family":"Inoue","given":"Tomoo"}],"event-place":"Cham","event-title":"Collaboration Technologies and Social Computing - 26th International Conference, CollabTech 2020","ISBN":"978-3-030-58156-5 978-3-030-58157-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"159-166","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Quantifying Collaboration Quality in Face-to-Face Classroom Settings Using MMLA","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-58157-2_11","volume":"12324"},

We designed an AR application, where two participants can work together to solve a programming task, and conducted a within-subject study to evaluate how the participants' code editing and vocal communication are different in the AR and non-AR visualizations.

We found that our tabletop interface facilitated the creation of more ideas and participants tended to create more categories. We observed that the tabletop provides a useful record of the group processes and this is valuable for reviewing how well a group followed recommended brainstorming processes.

  {"id":"considineTeambasedLearningNursing2021","abstract":"Aims and objectives To explore the use and student outcomes of Team-Based Learning in nursing education. Background Team-Based Learning is a highly structured, evidence-based, student-centred learning strategy that enhances student engagement and facilitates deep learning in a variety of disciplines including nursing. However, the breadth of Team-Based Learning application in nursing education and relevant outcomes are not currently well understood. Design A scoping review of international, peer-reviewed research studies was undertaken according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews. Methods The following databases were searched on 7 May 2020: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO and Education Resources Information Center. Search terms related to nursing, education and Team-Based Learning. Original research studies, published in English, and reporting on student outcomes from Team-Based Learning in nursing education programmes were included. Results Of the 1081 potentially relevant citations, 41 studies from undergraduate (n = 29), postgraduate (n = 4) and hospital (n = 8) settings were included. The most commonly reported student outcomes were knowledge or academic performance (n = 21); student experience, satisfaction or perceptions of Team-Based Learning (n = 20); student engagement with behaviours or attitudes towards Team-Based Learning (n = 12); and effect of Team-Based Learning on teamwork, team performance or collective efficacy (n = 6). Only three studies reported clinical outcomes. Conclusions Over the last decade, there has been a growing body of knowledge related to the use of Team-Based Learning in nursing education. The major gaps identified in this scoping review were the lack of randomised controlled trials and the dearth of studies of Team-Based Learning in postgraduate and hospital contexts. Relevance to clinical practice This scoping review provides a comprehensive understanding of the use and student outcomes of Team-Based Learning in nursing education and highlights the breadth of application of Team-Based Learning and variability in the outcomes reported.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Considine","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Berry","given":"Debra"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Hewitt","given":"Nicky"},{"family":"Oldland","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Sprogis","given":"Stephanie K."},{"family":"Currey","given":"Judy"}],"citation-key":"considineTeambasedLearningNursing2021","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Nursing","DOI":"10.1111/jocn.15599","ISSN":"1365-2702","issue":"7-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"903-917","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Team-based learning in nursing education: A scoping review","title-short":"Team-based learning in nursing education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.15599","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"cressCoconstructingKnowledgeGenerative2023","abstract":"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, have received great attention from researchers, the media, and the public. They are gladly and frequently used for text production by many people. These tools have undeniable strengths but also weaknesses that must be addressed. In this squib we ask to what extent these tools can be employed by users for individual learning as well as for knowledge construction to spark a collective endeavor of developing new insights. We take a social, collective notion of knowledge as a basis and argue that users need to establish a dialog that goes beyond knowledge telling (simply writing what one knows) and stimulates knowledge transformation (converting knowledge into complex relational argumentation structures). Generative AI tools do not have any conceptual knowledge or conscious understanding, as they only use word transitions and rely on probabilities of word classes. We suggest, however, that argumentative dialogs among humans and AI tools can be achieved with appropriate prompts, where emergent processes of joint knowledge construction can take place. Based on this assumption, we inquire into the human and into the AI parts of communication and text production. For our line of argument, we borrow from research on individual and collaborative writing, group cognition, and the co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. We outline future CSCL research paths that might take the human-AI co-construction of knowledge into account in terms of terminology, theory, and methodology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cress","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Kimmerle","given":"Joachim"}],"citation-key":"cressCoconstructingKnowledgeGenerative2023","container-title":"International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning","container-title-short":"Intern.

However, there is a great deal of AI technology found in non-autonomous systems that are used as cognitive tools by humans. Under the extended mind thesis, the functional contributions of these tools become as essential to our cognition as our brains. But AI can take cognitive extension towards totally new capabil- ities, posing new philosophical, ethical and technical chal- lenges. To analyse these challenges better, we define and place AI extenders in a continuum between fully-externalized systems, loosely coupled with humans, and fully-internalized processes, with operations ultimately performed by the brain, making the tool redundant. We dissect the landscape of cog- nitive capabilities that can foreseeably be extended by AI and examine their ethical implications. We suggest that cognitive extenders using AI be treated as distinct from other cognitive enhancers by all relevant stakeholders, including developers, policy makers, and human users.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cukurova","given":"Mutlu"}],"citation-key":"cukurovaLearningAnalyticsAI2019","DOI":"10.17863/CAM.36128","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,27]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","publisher":"Apollo - University of Cambridge Repository","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Learning Analytics as AI Extenders in Education: Multimodal Machine Learning versus Multimodal Learning Analytics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/288862"},

Most research in learning analytics focuses on student interaction in digital learning environments, yet still most learning and teaching in schools occurs in physical environments. Investigation of student interaction in physical environments can be used to generate observable differences among students, which can then be used in the design and implementation of Learning Analytics. Here, we present several original methods for identifying such differences in groups CPS behaviours. Our data set is based on human observation, hand position (fiducial marker) and heads direction (face recognition) data from eighteen students working in six groups of three. The results show that the high competent CPS groups spend an equal distribution of time on their problem-solving and collaboration stages. Whereas, the low competent CPS groups spend most of their time in identifying knowledge and skill deficiencies only. Moreover, as machine observable data shows, high competent CPS groups present symmetrical contributions to the physical tasks and present high synchrony and individual accountability values. The findings have significant implications on the design and implementation of future learning analytics systems.","author":[{"family":"Cukurova","given":"Mutlu"},{"family":"Luckin","given":"Rose"},{"family":"Mavrikis","given":"Manolis"},{"family":"Millán","given":"Eva"}],"citation-key":"cukurovaMachineHumanObservable2017","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Data Driven Approaches in Digital Education","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-66610-5_2","editor":[{"family":"Lavoué","given":"Élise"},{"family":"Drachsler","given":"Hendrik"},{"family":"Verbert","given":"Katrien"},{"family":"Broisin","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Pérez-Sanagustín","given":"Mar"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-66610-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"17-29","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Machine and Human Observable Differences in Groups’ Collaborative Problem-Solving Behaviours","type":"paper-conference"},

We have collected ~500 mins video data from 15 groups of 3 students working to solve design problems collaboratively. Initially, with the help of OpenPose, we automatically generated frequency metrics such as the number of the face-in-the-screen; and distance metrics such as the distance between bodies. Based on these metrics, we built decision trees to predict students' listening, watching, making, and speaking behaviours as well as predicting the students' CPS competence. Our results provide useful decision rules mined from analytics of video data which can be used to inform teacher dashboards. Although, the accuracy and recall values of the models built are inferior to previous machine learning work that utilizes multimodal data, the transparent nature of the decision trees provides opportunities for explainable analytics for teachers and learners. This can lead to more agency of teachers and learners, therefore can lead to easier adoption.

Contrary to the early assumption that body movement only indicates emotional intensity, recent studies have shown that body movement and posture also conveys emotion specific information. However, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is hampered by a lack of production studies informed by a theoretical framework. In this research we adopted the Body Action and Posture (BAP) coding system to examine the types and patterns of body movement that are employed by 10 professional actors to portray a set of 12 emotions. We investigated to what extent these expression patterns support explicit or implicit predictions from basic emotion theory, bidimensional theory, and componential appraisal theory. The overall results showed partial support for the different theoretical approaches. They revealed that several patterns of body movement systematically occur in portrayals of specific emotions, allowing emotion differentiation. Although a few emotions were prototypically expressed by one particular pattern, most emotions were variably expressed by multiple patterns, many of which can be explained as reflecting functional components of emotion such as modes of appraisal and action readiness. It is concluded that further work in this largely underdeveloped area should be guided by an appropriate theoretical framework to allow a more systematic design of experiments and clear hypothesis testing.

The student groups participated in collaborative projects, which involved setting-up, conducting, and reporting on empirical research studies. This study sheds light on the nature of productive interactions, the joint efforts to co-construct knowledge and the shared epistemic agency expected to emerge when groups are addressing ill-structured, complex problems in a collaboration over time. In-depth qualitative analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze and interpret interaction data and developing knowledge objects (i.e., research reports) collected during a 20-week project period. The findings show that productive interactions can take different forms, with discourse-based and object-oriented being the most relevant patterns arising. In the latter case, the emergent knowledge objects also influence the course and productivity of the interaction. Finally, groups manifesting shared epistemic agency produce knowledge objects more complex and suitable to the problems addressed. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the collaborative learning process that includes work on knowledge objects over time. The implications for the educational practice and further research point towards the need for a better understanding of the way groups function when challenged to address complex problems and to participate in knowledge production, how these processes can benefit learning, and what is needed in terms of pedagogical and technological support, to enable students to be more than mere course-takers, but also producers of knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Damşa","given":"Crina I."}],"citation-key":"damsaMultilayeredNatureSmallgroup2014","container-title":"International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning","container-title-short":"Intern.

  {"id":"damsaStudentLearningParticipation2016","abstract":"The two case studies reported in this article contribute to a better understanding of how inquiry tasks and activities are employed as resourceful means for learning in higher professional education. An observation-based approach was used to explore characteristics of and challenges in students’ participation in collaborative inquiry activities in two first-year introductory courses in teacher and computer engineering education. The findings highlight that the students’ activities varied with regard to focus and structure and were shaped by the types of inquiry tasks, i.e. case analysis and project-based work, by how the inquiry process was guided and supported and the way the domain-specific knowledge resources and practices were introduced. An exploratory strategy and rather confined use of resources characterised the teacher education students’ inquiry, while collaborative programming, a trial-and-error approach and extensive use of external resources that of the engineering education students’. For the teacher students, the main challenge was to construct meaning of conceptual knowledge and to integrate different forms of knowledge as a lens for analysing practice. The computer engineering students experienced challenges with unpacking the underlying principles and knowledge black-boxed in the widely available resources. The article suggests that future research and curriculum designs should depart from a more refined understanding of inquiry as a learning means, by connecting inquiry activities to the specific knowledge domains, the type of tasks most suited to explore each of this domains and the challenges that may arise for students.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Damşa","given":"Crina I."},{"family":"Nerland","given":"Monika"}],"citation-key":"damsaStudentLearningParticipation2016","container-title":"Vocations and Learning","container-title-short":"Vocations and Learning","DOI":"10.1007/s12186-016-9152-9","ISSN":"1874-7868","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"275-294","source":"Springer Link","title":"Student Learning Through Participation in Inquiry Activities: Two Case Studies in Teacher and Computer Engineering Education","title-short":"Student Learning Through Participation in Inquiry Activities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12186-016-9152-9","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"dascaluCOVID19CohesionNetwork2021","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the entire world, while the impact and usage of online learning environments has greatly increased. This paper presents a new version of the ReaderBench framework, grounded in Cohesion Network Analysis, which can be used to evaluate the online activity of students as a plug-in feature to Moodle. A Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM cells that combines global features, including participation and initiation indices, with a time series analysis on timeframes is used to predict student grades, while multiple sociograms are generated to observe interaction patterns. Students’ behaviors and interactions are compared before and during COVID-19 using two consecutive yearly instances of an undergraduate course in Algorithm Design, conducted in Romanian using Moodle. The COVID-19 outbreak generated an off-balance, a drastic increase in participation, followed by a decrease towards the end of the semester, compared to the academic year 2018–2019 when lower fluctuations in participation were observed. The prediction model for the 2018–2019 academic year obtained an R2 of 0.27, while the model for the second year obtained a better R2 of 0.34, a value arguably attributable to an increased volume of online activity. Moreover, the best model from the first academic year is partially generalizable to the second year, but explains a considerably lower variance (R2 = 0.13). In addition to the quantitative analysis, a qualitative analysis of changes in student behaviors using comparative sociograms further supported conclusions that there were drastic changes in student behaviors observed as a function of the COVID-19 pandemic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Dascalu","given":"Maria-Dorinela"},{"family":"Ruseti","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Dascalu","given":"Mihai"},{"family":"McNamara","given":"Danielle S."},{"family":"Carabas","given":"Mihai"},{"family":"Rebedea","given":"Traian"},{"family":"Trausan-Matu","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"dascaluCOVID19CohesionNetwork2021","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2021.106780","ISSN":"0747-5632","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"page":"106780","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Before and during COVID-19: A Cohesion Network Analysis of students’ online participation in moodle courses","title-short":"Before and during COVID-19","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563221001035","volume":"121"},
  {"id":"davidsenThisSizeOne2017","abstract":"In CSCL studies, language is often foregrounded as the primary resource for engaging in collaborative learning, while the body is more often positioned as a secondary resource. There is, however, a growing interest in the body as a resource in learning and collaboration in and outside CSCL. In this paper, we present, analyse, and discuss how two nine-year-old children collaborate through gesturing and moving their bodies around a touchscreen. The pair is working with the concept of scale and area measurement and are in midst of copying their rooms from paper to touchscreen. During this process, the pair engages in a discussion regarding the size of one meter through language, gestures and manipulation of the material resources. The analysis shows two distinct ways of understanding the length of one meter, which primarily are visible through the children’s gestures and bodily movements. In the analysis we show how the children dynamically produce body-material resources for communicative and illustrative purposes; moreover, they use body-material resources as a cognitive tool and as a way of shepherding each other. The study forms part of a body of studies analysing and theorizing the body in education, learning, and interaction. We discuss the wider impact of our findings and argue how they may challenge and improve studies relying mainly on a coding and counting approach or automated capture of e.g. gestures. In addition, we provide a detailed multimodal representation of the subtle bodily-material resources, which we argue is a modest contribution to a catalogue of ways of representing and making bodily-material resources visible in CSCL research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Davidsen","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Ryberg","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"davidsenThisSizeOne2017","container-title":"International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning","container-title-short":"Intern.

  {"id":"dick-smithComparingRealTimeFeedback2020","abstract":"Background\nOptimal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is reliant on a chain of well performed interventions and skills. To investigate whether CPR feedback devices improve performance for nursing students, the effects of three feedback modalities—visual: Laerdal SimPad®; visual-embodied metaphoric: Innosonian Brayden Pro®; and visual-audio: Physio-Control TrueCPR®—was tested.\nMethod\nA quasi-experimental cross-over study compared performance metrics of participant exposure to three feedback modalities and standard adult basic life support (BLS) without feedback in a simulated environment. After baseline training, 64 participants performed adult single-rescuer BLS on a manikin for each modality and without feedback for two minutes. Effective chest compressions (correct depth, thoracic recoil, pressure point, rate, no-flow fraction) and ventilation parameters were compared using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests.\nResults\nSuperior technical accuracy in CPR skills performance was evident with all feedback modalities when compared with no feedback p = <.05); visual-audio feedback (TrueCPR®) was most effective (p = .005). Participants demonstrated higher technical accuracy in CPR performance (30:2 cycles; chest compression number/rate/depth; chest recoil; pressure point; correct number of ventilations) when compared with no feedback (p = .0001), despite achieving national certification three weeks before data collection.\nConclusion\nThis appears to be the first study to explore the use of feedback modalities during CPR performance in nursing students. These feedback devices can play a major role in improving measurable parameters of BLS and psychomotor skill capability. Modalities varied in their ability to improve performance; visual-audio feedback significantly improved chest compressions, ventilation and cycle performance, whereas visual-graph–based feedback improved flow fraction and ventilations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Dick-Smith","given":"Felicity"},{"family":"Elliott","given":"Doug"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Power","given":"Tamara"}],"citation-key":"dick-smithComparingRealTimeFeedback2020","collection-title":"Patient Safety","container-title":"Clinical Simulation in Nursing","container-title-short":"Clinical Simulation in Nursing","DOI":"10/gpb4mx","ISSN":"1876-1399","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"59-67","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Comparing Real-Time Feedback Modalities to Support Optimal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Quasi-Experimental Cross-Over Simulation Study","title-short":"Comparing Real-Time Feedback Modalities to Support Optimal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Undergraduate Nursing Students","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876139920300104","volume":"44"},

The VIT is a crucial component that was so far missing in the available tools for MMLA research.

The landscape of sensors and wearable trackers that can be used for learning support is evolving rapidly, as well as data collection and analysis methods. Multimodal data can now be collected and processed in real time at an unprecedented scale. With sensors, it is possible to capture observable events of the learning process such as learner's behaviour and the learning context. The learning process, however, consists also of latent attributes, such as the learner's cognitions or emotions. These attributes are unobservable to sensors and need to be elicited by human-driven interpretations. We conducted a literature survey of experiments using multimodal data to frame the young research field of multimodal learning analytics. The survey explored the multimodal data used in related studies (the input space) and the learning theories selected (the hypothesis space). The survey led to the formulation of the Multimodal Learning Analytics Model whose main objectives are of (O1) mapping the use of multimodal data to enhance the feedback in a learning context; (O2) showing how to combine machine learning with multimodal data; and (O3) aligning the terminology used in the field of machine learning and learning science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Di Mitri","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Specht","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Drachsler","given":"Hendrik"}],"citation-key":"dimitriSignalsKnowledgeConceptual2018","container-title":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","DOI":"10.1111/jcal.12288","ISSN":"1365-2729","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"338-349","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"From signals to knowledge: A conceptual model for multimodal learning analytics","title-short":"From signals to knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcal.12288","volume":"34"},

Models are trained and validated independently of the teacher to ensure generalization to new teachers. We are able to distinguish questions and non-questions with a weighted F1 score of 0.69. A comparison of the three feature sets indicates that a model using linguistic features outperforms those using acoustic-prosodic and context features for question detection, but the combination of features yields a 5% improvement in overall accuracy compared to linguistic features alone. We discuss applications for pedagogical research, teacher formative assessment, and teacher professional development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Donnelly","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Blanchard","given":"Nathaniel"},{"family":"Olney","given":"Andrew M."},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Nystrand","given":"Martin"},{"family":"D'Mello","given":"Sidney K."}],"citation-key":"donnellyWordsMatterAutomatic2017","collection-title":"LAK '17","container-title":"Proceedings of the Seventh International Learning Analytics & Knowledge Conference","DOI":"10/gpb4m3","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4870-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,13]]},"page":"218–227","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Words matter: automatic detection of teacher questions in live classroom discourse using linguistics, acoustics, and context","title-short":"Words matter","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3027385.3027417"},

The theory emphasizes that persons are participants involved in personal trajectories in relation to structural arrangements of social practice. It is intended to lead to a richer and worldlier psychology. It also leads to a different understanding of professional psychological practices and of their users. To illuminate this, I present key insights from a study of clients attending therapy. Client changes do not occur only in therapeutic sessions but also in and across the contexts in which these clients live their lives in structures of social practice.

Using a novel \"devil’s advocate\" paradigm, we experimentally elicited deception and truth across topics in which conversational partners either agreed or disagreed, and where one partner was surreptitiously asked to argue an opinion opposite of what he or she really believed. We focus on interpersonal coordination as an emergent behavioral signal that captures interdependencies between conversational partners, both as the coupling of head movements over the span of milliseconds, measured via a windowed lagged cross correlation (WLCC) technique, and more global temporal dependencies across speech rate, using cross recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA). Moreover, we considered how interpersonal coordination might be shaped by strategic, adaptive conversational goals associated with deception. We found that deceptive conversations displayed more structured speech rate and higher head movement coordination, the latter with a peak in deceptive disagreement conversations. Together the results allow us to posit an adaptive account, whereby interpersonal coordination is not beholden to any single functional explanation, but can strategically adapt to diverse conversational demands.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Duran","given":"Nicholas D."},{"family":"Fusaroli","given":"Riccardo"}],"citation-key":"duranConversingDevilAdvocate2017","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0178140","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e0178140","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Conversing with a devil’s advocate: Interpersonal coordination in deception and disagreement","title-short":"Conversing with a devil’s advocate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178140","volume":"12"},

Team members' embodied, multimodal interaction with each other and artefacts has been studied by researchers, but due to its complexity, has remained opaque to automated analysis. However, the ready availability of sensors makes it increasingly affordable to instrument work spaces to study teamwork and groupwork. The possibility of visualising key aspects of a collaboration has huge potential for both academic and professional learning, but a frontline challenge is the enrichment of quantitative data streams with the qualitative insights needed to make sense of them. In response, we introduce the concept of collaboration translucence, an approach to make visible selected features of group activity. This is grounded both theoretically (in the physical, epistemic, social and affective dimensions of group activity), and contextually (using domain-specific concepts). We illustrate the approach from the automated analysis of healthcare simulations to train nurses, generating four visual proxies that fuse multimodal data into higher order patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Echeverria","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Buckingham Shum","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"echeverriaCollaborationTranslucenceGiving2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-5970-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"1–16","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Towards Collaboration Translucence: Giving Meaning to Multimodal Group Data","title-short":"Towards Collaboration Translucence","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300269"},
  {"id":"echeverriaDBCollabAutomatedFeedback","abstract":"Developing effective teamwork and collaboration skills is regarded as a key graduate attribute for employability. As a result, higher education institutions are striving to help students foster these skills through authentic learning scenarios. Although face-to-face (f2f) group tasks are common in most classrooms, it is challenging to collect evidence about the group processes. As a result, to date, it is difficult to assess group tasks in ways other than through teachers’ direct observations and students’ self-reports, or by measuring the quality of their final product. However, there are other critical aspects of group-work that students need to receive feedback on, for example, interaction dynamics or the collaboration processes. This paper explores the potential of using interactive surfaces and sensors to track key indicators of group-work, in order to provide automated feedback about epistemic and social aspects. We conducted a pilot study in an authentic classroom, in the context of database design. The contributions of this paper are: 1) the operationalisation of the DBCollab tool as a means for supporting group database design and collecting multimodal traces of the activity using interactive surfaces and sensors; and 2) empirical evidence that points at the potential of presenting these traces to group members in order to provoke immediate and post-hoc productive reflection about their activity.","author":[{"family":"Echeverria","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Chiluiza","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Shum","given":"Simon BUCKINGHAM"}],"citation-key":"echeverriaDBCollabAutomatedFeedback","language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"DBCollab: Automated Feedback for Face-to-Face Group Database Design","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"echeverriaDesigningFeedbackCollocated2020","abstract":"The ability to communicate, be an effective team or group member and collaborate face-to-face are critical skills for employability in the 21st century workplace. Previous research suggests that learning to collaborate effectively requires practice, awareness of group dynamics and reflection upon past activities. However, although having a teacher closely supervising and providing detailed feedback to each group would be ideal, it may be unrealistic in practice. A promising way to approach this challenge could be to capture behavioural traces from group interactions in order to generate comprehensible and actionable feedback to support team reflection. In this sense, Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) is a promising field, offering the potential to track learners’ activity across digital and collocated contexts, using emerging sensing and pervasive computing technologies. Most of the research in MMLA has been conducted in lab conditions, to help researchers validate learning theories or generate more comprehensive learner models. However, one of the most underexplored aspects of MMLA has been the generation of feedback to support teaching and learning, and moreover, in authentic locations and activities. This thesis reports progress in tackling this challenge by designing and validating computer-based feedback, by means of visual representations and narrative, to support effective, guided reflection using multimodal learning analytics evidence. To achieve this, three contributions are presented. The first contribution is a human-centred design method to translate the informal outputs of co-design sessions with teachers and students, into more meaningful group work constructs with clear MMLA design requirements. The second contribution is a modelling approach to add meaning to low-level multimodal group data based on the characteristics of the context (domain expertise, theory, and the learning design). Finally, the third contribution is an approach for augmenting visual representations with data storytelling elements to facilitate the interpretation of group dynamics insights by educators and students. This thesis is developed in the context of two distinct, collocated group work settings, in the domains of collaborative database design and healthcare simulation. Using a Design-Based Research process, a set of 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘺 interfaces (i.e. interfaces that communicate insights) was designed and validated with teachers and students.

  {"id":"ertmerPracticeEducationalInstructional2013","abstract":"WHAT IS DESIGN? Design has been defined in a number of ways, with designers from various fields (e.g., architecture, fashion, and education) conceptualizing and defining their work in slightly different ways. Although design can be used to describe both a process and a product (Smith & Boling, 2009), in this chapter, we focus primarily on the process, or ‘work’, of design. Thus, design is defined here as a goal directed, problem-solving activity (Archer, 1965; Rowland, 1993), which results in the creation of something useful that did not exist previously (Reswick, 1965). Furthermore, we include the idea, proposed by Cross (2007), which describes design as occurring within a complex conceptual space, comprising both opportunities and constraints, which must be resolved in order to achieve desired and effective results. This definition, then, encapsulates the complex space within which designers work, while also suggesting that design often involves the resolution of competing tensions or priorities. In educational/instructional design, these tensions arise from competition between such things as learning outcomes, policy guidelines, graduate attributes, and students’ needs and expectations (Bird, Morgan, & O’Reilly, 2007).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ertmer","given":"Peggy A."},{"family":"Parisio","given":"Martin L."},{"family":"Wardak","given":"Dewa"}],"citation-key":"ertmerPracticeEducationalInstructional2013","DOI":"10.4324/9780203075227-7","ISBN":"978-0-203-07522-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,26]]},"language":"en","page":"17-31","publisher":"Routledge","source":"www-taylorfrancis-com.ezproxy.uio.no","title":"The Practice of Educational/Instructional Design","type":"book","URL":"http://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203075227-7/practice-educational-instructional-design-peggy-ertmer-martin-parisio-dewa-wardak"},
  {"id":"evansMultimodalApproachCoding2011","abstract":"Our research aims to identify children’s communicative strategies when faced with the task of solving a geometric puzzle in CSCL contexts. We investigated how to identify and trace distributed cognition in problem-solving interactions based on discursive cohesion to objects, participants, and prior discursive content, and geometric and cooperative concepts. We report on the development of a method of coding and representation of verbal and gestural content for multimodal interactional data and initial application of this framework to a microethnographic case study of two small groups of 7 and 8-year-old learners solving tangram manipulatives in physical and virtual desktop settings. We characterize the establishment of shared reference points as “coreferences” which cohere on object, para, and meta-levels through both gesture and speech. Our analysis foregrounds how participants establish common referential ground to facilitate collaborative problem solving with either computer-supported or physical puzzles. Using multimodal analysis and a theoretical framework we developed to study interactional dynamics, we identified patterns of focus, dominance, and coalition formation as they relate to coreferentiality on multiple levels. Initial findings indicate increased communication and cohesion to higher-level principles in the virtual tangram puzzle-solving setting.

  {"id":"ewensteinKnowledgePracticesDesign2009","abstract":"We use a detailed study of the knowledge work around visual representations to draw attention to the multidimensional nature of `objects'. Objects are variously described in the literatures as relatively stable or in flux; as abstract or concrete; and as used within or across practices. We clarify these dimensions, drawing on and extending the literature on boundary objects, and connecting it with work on epistemic and technical objects. In particular, we highlight the epistemic role of objects, using our observations of knowledge work on an architectural design project to show how, in this setting, visual representations are characterized by a `lack' or incompleteness that precipitates unfolding. The conceptual design of a building involves a wide range of technical, social and aesthetic forms of knowledge that need to be developed and aligned. We explore how visual representations are used, and how these are meaningful to different stakeholders, eliciting their distinct contributions. As the project evolves and the drawings change, new issues and needs for knowledge work arise. These objects have an `unfolding ontology' and are constantly in flux, rather than fully formed. We discuss the implications for wider understandings of objects in organizations and for how knowledge work is achieved in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ewenstein","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Whyte","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"ewensteinKnowledgePracticesDesign2009","container-title":"Organization Studies","container-title-short":"Organization Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0170840608083014","ISSN":"0170-8406, 1741-3044","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1]]},"language":"en","page":"07-30","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Knowledge Practices in Design: The Role of Visual Representations as `Epistemic Objects'","title-short":"Knowledge Practices in Design","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0170840608083014","volume":"30"},

Many adaptive learning environments model students' natural language input, and there is growing recognition that these systems can be improved by leveraging multimodal cues to understand learners better. This paper investigates multimodal features related to posture and gesture for the task of classifying students' dialogue acts within tutorial dialogue. In order to accelerate the modeling process by eliminating the manual annotation bottleneck, a fully unsupervised machine learning approach is utilized for this task. The results indicate that these unsupervised models are significantly improved with the addition of automatically extracted posture and gesture information. Further, even in the absence of any linguistic features, a model that utilizes posture and gesture features alone performed significantly better than a majority class baseline. This work represents a step toward achieving better understanding of student utterances by incorporating multimodal features within adaptive learning environments. Additionally, the technique presented here is scalable to very large student datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ezen-Can","given":"Aysu"},{"family":"Grafsgaard","given":"Joseph F."},{"family":"Lester","given":"James C."},{"family":"Boyer","given":"Kristy Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"ezen-canClassifyingStudentDialogue2015","collection-title":"LAK '15","container-title":"Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Learning Analytics And Knowledge","DOI":"10.1145/2723576.2723588","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3417-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"280–289","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Classifying student dialogue acts with multimodal learning analytics","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/2723576.2723588"},

While dashboards and other visualizations are proliferating, the evidence is that many fail to provide meaningful insights that help students reflect productively. The contribution of this article is qualitative and quantitative evidence from two studies evaluating a multimodal teamwork analytics tool in authentic clinical teamwork simulations. Collocated activity data are rendered to help nursing students reflect on errors and stress-related incidents during simulations. The user interface explicitly guides student reflection using data storytelling principles, tuned to the intended learning outcomes. The results demonstrate the potential of interfaces that “tell one data story at a time,” by helping students to identify misconceptions and errors; think about strategies they might use to address errors, and reflect on their arousal levels. The results also illuminate broader issues around automated formative assessment, and the intelligibility and accountability of learning analytics.","author":[{"family":"Fernandez-Nieto","given":"Gloria Milena"},{"family":"Echeverria","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Shum","given":"Simon Buckingham"},{"family":"Mangaroska","given":"Katerina"},{"family":"Kitto","given":"Kirsty"},{"family":"Palominos","given":"Evelyn"},{"family":"Axisa","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"fernandez-nietoStorytellingLearnerData2021","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","DOI":"10/gpb4mh","ISSN":"1939-1382","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"695-708","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data","title-short":"Storytelling With Learner Data","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"fernandez-nietoWhatCanAnalytics2021","abstract":"Effective teamwork is critical to improve patient outcomes in healthcare. However, achieving this capabilityrequires that pre-service nurses develop the spatial abilities they will require in their clinical placements, suchas: learning when to remain close to the patient and to other team members; positioning themselves correctlyat the right time; and deciding on specific team formations (e.g. face-to-face or side-by-side) to enable effectiveinteraction or avoid disrupting clinical procedures. However, positioning dynamics are ephemeral and caneasily become occluded by the multiple tasks nurses have to accomplish. Digital traces automatically capturedby indoor positioning sensors can be used to address this problem for the purpose of improving nurses' reflection, learning and professional development. This paper presents; i) a qualitative study that illustrateshow to elicit spatial behaviours from educators' pedagogical expectations, and ii) a modelling approachthat transforms nurses' low-level position traces into higher-order proxemics constructs, informed by sucheducatos' expectations, in the context of simulation-based teamwork training. To illustrate our modellingapproach, we conducted an in-the-wild study with 55 undergraduate students and five educators from whompositioning traces were captured in eleven authentic nursing education classes. Low-levelx-ydata was usedto model three proxemic constructs: i) co-presence in interactional spaces, ii) socio-spatial formations (i.e.f-formations), and ii) presence in spaces of interest. Through a number of vignettes, we illustrate how indoorpositioning analytics can be used to address questions that educators and researchers have about teamwork inhealthcare simulation settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernandez-Nieto","given":"Gloria"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Echeverria","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Kitto","given":"Kirsty"},{"family":"An","given":"Pengcheng"},{"family":"Buckingham Shum","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"fernandez-nietoWhatCanAnalytics2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction","container-title-short":"Proc.

Despite these acknowledged problems, few suggestions have been made as to how we might improve the visual design of LA tools to support richer and alternative ways to communicate student data insights. In this paper, we explore three design alternatives to represent student multimodal data insights by combining data visualisation, narratives and storytelling principles. Based on foundations in data storytelling, three visual-narrative interfaces were designed with teachers: i) visual data slices, ii) a tabular visualisation, and iii) a written report. These were validated as a part of an authentic study where teachers explored activity logs and physiological data from co-located collaborative learning classes in the context of healthcare education.

  {"id":"feyStateResearchSimulation2017","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for quality nurses and nursing education. Virtual simulation emerged as a key component of providing clinical experiences to nursing students.\nCommercial virtual simulation products can be costly, and it is difficult to ensure the content meets student needs. In addition, there is a potential for cheating as answers are available online.\nFaculty recorded 16 different scenarios in pre-determined segments, including patient report, assessment, provider communication, and conclusion. During the clinical experience, the students watched the videos and participated in faculty-led discussion. At the conclusion of the activity, students completed a reflection assignment providing qualitative data for review.\nStudent feedback was positive. Themes identified in the comments include critical thinking, variety of scenarios, observer role, debriefing, and overall quality of experience.\nHomemade virtual clinical has the potential to be a low-cost, high-impact method for virtual simulation across nursing curricula. Further research is needed.\nCette étude s’intéresse au processus de professionnalisation d’étudiants en soins infirmiers. Elle vise plus précisément à comprendre comment chaque étape d’un apprentissage par simulation favorise l’acquisition de compétences chez des étudiants en soins infirmiers. Au total, quarante-sept étudiants ont participé à cette étude. Ils étaient inscrits en première année de formation et répondaient de façon anonyme, aux quatre temps de la démarche de recherche, à un questionnaire composé de six questions permettant de mesurer leur opinion quant à l’acquisition de compétences au cours d’un apprentissage par simulation. Chaque question était construite autour de l’un des six savoirs définis par Le Boterf, 1997, Le Boterf, 2007, Le Boterf, 2011 dans son modèle théorique de la compétence. Les résultats obtenus mettent en évidence que chaque étape de la formation par simulation modifie significativement l’opinion que les étudiants ont de leurs différents savoirs. Et, le débriefing, qui constitue un élément essentiel de l’apprentissage par simulation, s’avère être l’étape la plus complexe étant donné les multiples processus psycho-cognitifs et émotionnels qui y sont en jeu.\nOur study focuses on the professionalization process in nursing students. More specifically, it aims to understand how each step of simulation in nursing education contributes to skills development in nursing students. In total, forty-seven students participated in this study. All the learners were first year students and answered anonymously, at the four stages of the research process, to a questionnaire consisting of six questions to measure their opinion on the acquisition of skills during a learning session based on simulation. Each question was built on one of the six forms of knowledge defined by Le Boterf, 1997, Le Boterf, 2007, Le Boterf, 2011 in his theoretical model of competence. The results show that each stage of the simulation training significantly modifies the students’ opinion on the different forms of knowledge they have acquired. Moreover, the debriefing, that is an essential part of simulation learning, proves to be the most complex stage given the multiple psycho-cognitive and emotional processes involved.\nLittle is known about the clinical impact of simulation-based education (SBE) for hospital nurses.\nScoping review methodology was used to examine the impact of nurse SBE programs within six patient safety domains.\nTwenty-six articles described over 20 education topics. Based on Kirkpatrick's four levels of evaluation, programs prioritized superficial levels of evaluation: Level 1—Reaction, Level 2—Learning. Only seven studies measured Level 3—Behavior change (nurses' performance) or Level 4—Results (impact on patient care).\nNurses' CPD programs should include both short-term evaluations and longitudinal measures to detect practice improvements that may advance patient safety.\nIn the midst of the international opioid-related overdose (OOD) crisis, appropriate naloxone training is needed by both healthcare professionals and community members to better leverage its life-saving potential.\nPilot the use of a virtual reality simulation for training student nurses to identify signs and symptoms of an OOD, properly administer intranasal naloxone, and provide immediate recovery care after revival.\nThis quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study evaluated knowledge and attitudes towards intervening during an opioid-related overdose among student nurses before and after participating in a traditional hybrid simulation or virtual reality simulation.\nA medium sized urban university's school of nursing in the Northeastern United States.\nFifty (N = 50) senior Bachelor of Nursing Science (BSN) students.\nKnowledge and attitudes were assessed using the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) and Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS). Students completed measures 3 weeks prior to training and 3 weeks after. Appropriate t-tests evaluated changes in OOAS and OOKS scores both within and between training groups (e.g. hybrid simulation compared to virtual reality).\nSample characteristics were well balanced in both the hybrid simulation group (n = 31) and virtual reality group (n = 19). There were no statistically significant differences in average OOKS and OOAS scores at baseline or at follow up between those receiving hybrid simulation or the virtual reality training. All participants' attitudes scores decreased from baseline to follow up by <2 points. However, there was no difference in the change in knowledge scores between the training groups.\nIndividuals participating in the virtual reality simulation had similar knowledge retention and attitudes towards responding during an opioid-related overdose and administering intranasal naloxone when compared to individuals participating in hybrid simulation. The lack of significant findings between training groups indicates that the mobile virtual reality training is comparable to the in-person hybrid simulation for training nursing students to appropriately administer naloxone to reverse OOD and provide immediate recovery care after revival.\nSimulation, as an activity, is quite old. Sporadic use of simulation for health education has been reported for hundreds of years. Despite steady growth in its use starting in the 18th century, simulation for training health professions declined in the early 20th century before a revival in the 1960s. By creating Resusci Anne, the most famous resuscitation manikin, in 1960, Åsmund Lærdal paved the way for the commercialization of simulators and their widespread adoption for health education. Howard S. Barrows was pivotal in developing standardized patients and using them for assessment. In the early 1990s, David Gaba and his team were among the first to use simulation for training in patient safety and crisis management. Their work heralded the rise of immersive simulation and of high-technology patient simulators. The drive toward patient safety was arguably—and still may be—the major impetus for the development and widespread adoption of simulation. Several factors are contributing to the growth of simulation, including interprofessional education, the need to replace clinical hours with simulation, and the new competency-based approach to healthcare education and the development of “entrustable professional activities.” This chapter briefly summarizes the history of healthcare simulation and the major forces driving its adoption.\nAdvanced practice nurses are in a key position to meet the increasing demand for health care providers in North America, but the lack of clinical sites, qualified nursing faculty, and small preceptor pools hinder advanced practice nursing program expansion. Simulation is a pedagogical methodology that is used in advanced practice nursing education, yet regulatory agencies do not allow simulation to replace direct patient care experiences. Simulation enhances clinical experiences and allows for better learning and assessment. This article invites dialogue regarding the role of simulation in providing quality clinical educational experiences for the advanced practice nursing student.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fey","given":"Mary K."},{"family":"Kardong-Edgren","given":"Suzan \"Susie\""}],"citation-key":"feyStateResearchSimulation2017","container-title":"Journal of Professional Nursing","container-title-short":"Journal of Professional Nursing","DOI":"10.1016/j.profnurs.2017.10.009","ISSN":"8755-7223","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"397-398","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"State of Research on Simulation in Nursing Education Programs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755722317303757","volume":"33"},

In this article, we describe findings from a proof of concept study that explores the feasibility and utility of using Gunawardena’s Interaction Analysis Model (IAM) to evaluate health professions students’ knowledge construction processes in clinical placements. The IAM has been used to study knowledge construction processes in computer-supported collaborative learning environments, but not in interprofessional education. The IAM describes five phases of knowledge construction – sharing/comparing; exploring dissonance; co-constructing meaning; testing; coming to agreement/applying co-constructed knowledge – each representing a progressively higher-level learning process. Application of the IAM to learner dialogue proved labor-intensive but feasible and useful as a research tool to characterize learners’ knowledge construction behaviors. Our findings suggest that the IAM warrants further study and may offer a framework to guide the design of clinical placements and analysis of interprofessional learning behaviors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Floren","given":"Leslie Carstensen"},{"family":"Cate","given":"Olle","non-dropping-particle":"ten"},{"family":"Irby","given":"David M."},{"family":"O’Brien","given":"Bridget C."}],"citation-key":"florenInteractionAnalysisModel2021","container-title":"Journal of Interprofessional Care","DOI":"10.1080/13561820.2020.1797653","ISSN":"1356-1820","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,3]]},"page":"736-743","PMID":"32811214","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"An interaction analysis model to study knowledge construction in interprofessional education: proof of concept","title-short":"An interaction analysis model to study knowledge construction in interprofessional education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1797653","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"florenPreliminaryEvidenceTool2023","abstract":"Collaborative knowledge construction (KC) is an important process in interprofessional learning and a logical assessment target. A tool supporting the formative evaluation of KC behaviors ideally would be: 1) applicable to interprofessional teams of learners in clinical contexts; 2) informed by contemporary learning frameworks; 3) feasible and useful. No existing assessment tool meets these criteria. This paper describes the development and preliminary validity evidence for a Tool for Observing Construction of Knowledge in Interprofessional teams (TOCK-IP). Following literature review and needs assessment, the TOCK-IP was drafted based upon Gunawardena’s five-phase KC model. Educational expert review established content validity. Response process and internal structure validity, feasibility, and utility were assessed through step-wise evaluation. Faculty raters applied the tool to four videos of simulated interactions between health professions learners. Faculty ratings were compared to expert consensus ratings. Thematic analysis of post-rating survey and debrief allowed assessment of feasibility and utility. Across videos, faculty raters’ agreement was fair (n = 25; Fleiss’ kappa = 0.40, <0.001). Excellent agreement (95%) was found for raters’ scores compared to consensus rating. Faculty supported tool feasibility and utility. The TOCK-IP meets the three criteria for evaluating team-level KC and offers a progression roadmap to help learners move toward collaborative learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Floren","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Louise Pittenger","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Cate","given":"Olle","non-dropping-particle":"ten"},{"family":"M.

  {"id":"foxTeachingInterprofessionalTeamwork2018","abstract":"An expanding body of literature is examining interprofessional teamwork and its effect in healthcare. To produce capable healthcare professionals prepared to participate in interprofessional roles, teamwork training must begin early in health professional students' training. The focus of this scoping review was to explore interprofessional education (IPE) studies designed to teach and/or assess interprofessional teamwork skills to students from two or more different health professions, to find and describe effective pedagogy and assessment strategies. Using a scoping review methodology, 1,106 abstracts were reviewed by three teams of investigators. Eligibility criteria were inclusion of students in interprofessional teams, an intervention to improve interprofessional teamwork skills and assessment of outcomes related to teamwork. Thirty-three studies met the criteria for inclusion. The literature was varied in terms of study design, teaching methods and assessment measures for interprofessional teamwork. The lack of rigorous, comparable studies in this area makes recommending one teaching method or assessment measure over another difficult. Regardless of teaching method, it appears that most learning activities where interprofessional teams interact result in positive changes in student perceptions and attitudes towards IPE and practice. As health education programs seek to incorporate more interprofessional activities into their respective programs, it is important to review methods and measures that would best fit their individual program. This review highlights the importance of standardising the reporting of methods and outcomes for those who wish to incorporate the studied methods into their curricula.","author":[{"family":"Fox","given":"Lanae"},{"family":"Onders","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Hermansen-Kobulnicky","given":"Carol J."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Thanh-Nga"},{"family":"Myran","given":"Leena"},{"family":"Linn","given":"Becky"},{"family":"Hornecker","given":"Jaime"}],"citation-key":"foxTeachingInterprofessionalTeamwork2018","container-title":"Journal of Interprofessional Care","container-title-short":"J Interprof Care","DOI":"10.1080/13561820.2017.1399868","ISSN":"1469-9567","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"127-135","PMID":"29172791","source":"PubMed","title":"Teaching interprofessional teamwork skills to health professional students: A scoping review","title-short":"Teaching interprofessional teamwork skills to health professional students","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"franzAcademicSocialIntegration2023","abstract":"IntroductionAcademic and social integration have been identified as key predictors of the decision to drop out by higher education students. So far, there is limited knowledge about whether there are differences in the degree of integration between teacher education students and students in other academic programs, although these differences might affect the decision-making process of students and their likelihood of dropping out. Furthermore, it is still unclear if the reasons for students dropping out of teacher education programs differ from those in other academic programs.MethodsThis study aims to address this research gap by examining integration and dropout rates of 8,237 students who were studying to become teachers, compared to students in similar fields of study in German higher education. The data for the study were collected from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS).ResultsThe results revealed significant differences between teacher education students and other students in peer and faculty social integration, but not in normative and structural academic integration. However, no moderation effect of the teacher education program on the association of integration and dropout was found.DiscussionThe findings contribute to the discussion on causes of dropout in teacher education by showing higher values in peer social integration and lower values in faculty social integration for teacher education students. These results complement previous research by providing new findings on the causes of students’ decision to drop out of initial teacher education. Practical implications on how to increase retention in teacher education programs are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Franz","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Paetsch","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"franzAcademicSocialIntegration2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Education","container-title-short":"Frontiers in Education","DOI":"10.3389/feduc.2023.1179264","ISSN":"2504-284X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"title":"Academic and social integration and their relation to dropping out of teacher education: a comparison to other study programs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2023.1179264","volume":"8"},

The approach posits that diﬀerent dimensions of collaborative learning emerging from social ties and content analysis of discourse can be modeled as networks. As such, the combination of social network analysis (SNA) and epistemic network analysis (ENA) analysis can detect information about a learner's enactment of what the literature on collaborative learning has described as a role: an ensemble of cognitive and social dimensions that is marked by interacting with the appropriate people about appropriate content. The proposed approach is named social epistemic network signature (SENS) and is deﬁned as a combination of these two complementary network analytic techniques. The proposed SENS approach is examined on data produced in collaborative activities performed in a massive open online course (MOOC) delivered via a major MOOC platform. The results of a study conducted on a data set collected in a MOOC suggest SNA and ENA produce complementary results which can i) explain collaboration processes that shaped the creation of social ties and that were associated with diﬀerent network roles; ii) describe diﬀerences between low and high performing groups of learners; and iii) show how combined properties derived from SNA and ENA predict academic performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Gašević","given":"Dragan"},{"family":"Joksimović","given":"Srećko"},{"family":"Eagan","given":"Brendan R."},{"family":"Shaffer","given":"David Williamson"}],"citation-key":"gasevicSENSNetworkAnalytics2019","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10/gf2bsm","ISSN":"07475632","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3]]},"language":"en","page":"562-577","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"SENS: Network analytics to combine social and cognitive perspectives of collaborative learning","title-short":"SENS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S074756321830325X","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"gatica-perezAutomaticNonverbalAnalysis2009","abstract":"An increasing awareness of the scientific and technological value of the automatic understanding of face-to-face social interaction has motivated in the past few years a surge of interest in the devising of computational techniques for conversational analysis. As an alternative to existing linguistic approaches for the automatic analysis of conversations, a relatively recent domain is using findings in social cognition, social psychology, and communication that have established the key role that nonverbal communication plays in the formation, maintenance, and evolution of a number of fundamental social constructs, which emerge from face-to-face interactions in time scales that range from short glimpses all the way to long-term encounters. Small group conversations are a specific case on which much of this work has been conducted. This paper reviews the existing literature on automatic analysis of small group conversations using nonverbal communication, and aims at bridging the current fragmentation of the work in this domain, currently split among half a dozen technical communities. The review is organized around the main themes studied in the literature and discusses, in a comparative fashion, about 100 works addressing problems related to the computational modeling of interaction management, internal states, personality traits, and social relationships in small group conversations, along with pointers to the relevant literature in social science. Some of the many open challenges and opportunities in this domain are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gatica-Perez","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"gatica-perezAutomaticNonverbalAnalysis2009","collection-title":"Visual and multimodal analysis of human spontaneous behaviour:","container-title":"Image and Vision Computing","container-title-short":"Image and Vision Computing","DOI":"10.1016/j.imavis.2009.01.004","ISSN":"0262-8856","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1775-1787","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Automatic nonverbal analysis of social interaction in small groups: A review","title-short":"Automatic nonverbal analysis of social interaction in small groups","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885609000109","volume":"27"},

Based on previous systematic literature reviews in MMLA and an additional new search, 35 MMLA works were identified that use theory. The results show that MMLA studies do not always discuss their findings within an established theoretical framework. Most of the theory-driven MMLA studies are positioned in the cognitive and affective domains, and the three most frequently used theories are embodied cognition, cognitive load theory and control–value theory of achievement emotions. Often, the theories are only used to inform the study design, but there is a relationship between the most frequently used theories and the data modalities used to operationalize those theories. Although studies such as these are rare, the findings indicate that MMLA affordances can, indeed, lead to theoretical contributions to learning sciences. In this work, we discuss methods of accelerating theory-driven MMLA research and how this acceleration can extend or even create new theoretical knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Giannakos","given":"Michail"},{"family":"Cukurova","given":"Mutlu"}],"citation-key":"giannakosRoleLearningTheory2023","container-title":"British Journal of Educational Technology","container-title-short":"Brit J Educational Tech","DOI":"10.1111/bjet.13320","ISSN":"0007-1013, 1467-8535","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,9]]},"language":"en","page":"bjet.13320","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The role of learning theory in multimodal learning analytics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.13320"},

This paper is a report of a study to identify experiences that led to both distress and eustress and to make recommendations to help students cope with course demands. Background. Much of the research on stress in nursing students is quantitative in focus and all draws on their experience of distress, with little attempt to understand experiences of eustress. Method. A series of focus groups were carried out with a volunteer sample of final year nursing students (n = 16) in the United Kingdom in 2007. The data were thematically analysed. Findings. The themes identified were clinical experience, support, learning and teaching experience and course structure. There were experiences within each that were perceived as sources of distress and eustress. Many of the sources of distress concur with earlier findings but they are more likely to be experienced and commented on because the demands of present-day programmes and the profile of many nursing students mean that more effort is invested in meeting educational demands. The experiential learning and patient-care opportunity that placements provided was an important source of eustress. Conclusion. Students who coped well drew on effective support networks and adopted a positive, optimistic perspective towards programme issues. Effective educators did not offer more time than those perceived as less effective but seemed more effective at tuning into students’ concerns, showing more empathy and offering clearer guidance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Gibbons","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Dempster","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Moutray","given":"Marianne"}],"citation-key":"gibbonsStressEustressNursing2008","container-title":"Journal of Advanced Nursing","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04497.x","ISSN":"1365-2648","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"282-290","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Stress and eustress in nursing students","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04497.x","volume":"61"},

However, we suggest that the dominant way of thinking about the relationship between representation and meaning results in an overemphasis on the UI, and that re-thinking this relationship is necessary to create systems that can facilitate deeper meaning making. We propose a conceptual view as a basis for discussion among the LA and HCI communities around a different way of thinking about meaning making, specifically that it should be explicit in the design process, provoking greater consideration of system level elements such as algorithms, data structures and information flow.

  {"id":"graesserAdvancingScienceCollaborative2018","abstract":"Collaborative problem solving (CPS) has been receiving increasing international attention because much of the complex work in the modern world is performed by teams. However, systematic education and training on CPS is lacking for those entering and participating in the workforce. In 2015, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a global test of educational progress, documented the low levels of proficiency in CPS. This result not only underscores a significant societal need but also presents an important opportunity for psychological scientists to develop, adopt, and implement theory and empirical research on CPS and to work with educators and policy experts to improve training in CPS. This article offers some directions for psychological science to participate in the growing attention to CPS throughout the world. First, it identifies the existing theoretical frameworks and empirical research that focus on CPS. Second, it provides examples of how recent technologies can automate analyses of CPS processes and assessments so that substantially larger data sets can be analyzed and so students can receive immediate feedback on their CPS performance. Third, it identifies some challenges, debates, and uncertainties in creating an infrastructure for research, education, and training in CPS. CPS education and assessment are expected to improve when supported by larger data sets and theoretical frameworks that are informed by psychological science. This will require interdisciplinary efforts that include expertise in psychological science, education, assessment, intelligent digital technologies, and policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Graesser","given":"Arthur C."},{"family":"Fiore","given":"Stephen M."},{"family":"Greiff","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Andrews-Todd","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Foltz","given":"Peter W."},{"family":"Hesse","given":"Friedrich W."}],"citation-key":"graesserAdvancingScienceCollaborative2018","container-title":"Psychological Science in the Public Interest","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci Public Interest","DOI":"10.1177/1529100618808244","ISSN":"1529-1006","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"59-92","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Advancing the Science of Collaborative Problem Solving","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1529100618808244","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"grafsgaardGenerativeMultimodalModels2018","abstract":"Positive interpersonal relationships require shared understanding along with a sense of rapport. A key facet of rapport is mirroring and convergence of facial expression and body language, known as nonverbal synchrony. We examined nonverbal synchrony in a study of 29 heterosexual romantic couples, in which audio, video, and bracelet accelerometer were recorded during three conversations. We extracted facial expression, body movement, and acoustic-prosodic features to train neural network models that predicted the nonverbal behaviors of one partner from those of the other. Recurrent models (LSTMs) outperformed feed-forward neural networks and other chance baselines.

However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. \n             \n             \n              Methods:  \n              Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework—Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA)—was used to examine the main review types. \n             \n             \n              Results:  \n              Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Greller","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Drachsler","given":"Hendrik"}],"citation-key":"grellerTranslatingLearningNumbers2012","container-title":"Journal of Educational Technology & Society","ISSN":"1176-3647","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"42-57","publisher":"International Forum of Educational Technology & Society","source":"JSTOR","title":"Translating Learning into Numbers: A Generic Framework for Learning Analytics","title-short":"Translating Learning into Numbers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/jeductechsoci.15.3.42","volume":"15"},

This study explores monitoring in collaborative learning. Specifically, it studies how students in a group monitor their cognitive, affective and behavioral processes during their collaboration, as well as how observed monitoring co-occurs with their physiological synchrony during the collaborative learning session. Data was collected from 48 Finnish highschool students who were learning about nutrition in groups of three. The session was videotaped and coded in terms of monitoring of cognition, behavior and affect. Students’ arousal was measured as electrodermal activity with wearable sensors and used to calculate physiological synchrony between the students. Three case groups, with priority on the quality of the data, were chosen for detailed analysis. The results indicate that the main targets of monitoring for these case groups were cognition and behavior, while monitoring of affect occurred the least. Most of the student pairs inside the groups showed significant amounts of physiological synchrony. High values of physiological synchrony occurred when monitoring was frequent. Time series analysis showed a weak positive connection between monitoring and physiological synchrony for two groups out of three. These results indicate that physiological synchrony could potentially shine a light on the joint regulation processes of collaborative learning groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Haataja","given":"Eetu"},{"family":"Malmberg","given":"Jonna"},{"family":"Järvelä","given":"Sanna"}],"citation-key":"haatajaMonitoringCollaborativeLearning2018","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.007","ISSN":"0747-5632","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"337-347","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Monitoring in collaborative learning: Co-occurrence of observed behavior and physiological synchrony explored","title-short":"Monitoring in collaborative learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321830284X","volume":"87"},

Each team consisted of two physicians, two registered nurses and two enrolled nurses, identical to a standard trauma team.\nResults The results in this study showed that the use of CO and CLC in trauma teams was limited, with an average of 20 CO and 2.8 CLC/team. Previous participation in trauma team training did not increase the frequency of use of CLC while ≥2 structured trauma courses correlated with increased use of CLC (risk ratio (RR) 3.17, CI 1.22 to 8.24). All professions in the trauma team were observed to initiate and terminate CLC (except for the enrolled nurse from the operation theatre). The frequency of team members’ use of CLC increased significantly with an egalitarian leadership style (RR 1.14, CI 1.04 to 1.26).\nConclusions This study showed that despite focus on the importance of communication in terms of CO and CLC, the difficulty in achieving safe and reliable verbal communication within the interdisciplinary team remained.

Often this is to provide concurrent feedback such as backchannels but sometimes it involves gestures that relate to the speciﬁc content of the speaker’s turn. We hypothesise that nonspeakers should contribute most actively during clariﬁcation sequences i.e. at the moments when mutualunderstanding is threatened. We test this hypothesis using a corpus of story-telling dialogues, captured using video and motion capture. The results show that during clariﬁcation sequences speaker and non-speaker behaviours tend to merge. Non-speakers in particular move their hands faster and produce more than twice as many content-speciﬁc speciﬁc gestures in overlap with speaker turns. These results underline the collaborative nature of conversation, the strategic importance of nonverbal resources for sustaining mutual-understanding and the critical role of clariﬁcation and repair in successful communication.","author":[{"family":"Healey","given":"Patrick G T"},{"family":"Plant","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Howes","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Lavelle","given":"Mary"}],"citation-key":"healeyWhenWordsFail","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"When Words Fail: Collaborative Gestures During Clariﬁcation Dialogues","type":"article-journal"},

Using the example of trials conducted in the design of a LA system, we aim to show how the analysis of physical movement from a macro level can help to enrich our understanding of what is happening in the classroom. The results suggest that Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) could be used to generate valuable information about the human factors of the collaborative learning process and we propose how this information could assist in the provision of relevant supports for small group work. More research is needed to confirm the initial findings with larger sample sizes and refine the data capture and analysis methodology to allow automation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Healion","given":"Donal"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Cukurova","given":"Mutlu"},{"family":"Spikol","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"healionTracingPhysicalMovement2017","collection-title":"LAK '17","container-title":"Proceedings of the Seventh International Learning Analytics & Knowledge Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3027385.3029474","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4870-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,13]]},"page":"588–589","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Tracing physical movement during practice-based learning through multimodal learning analytics","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3027385.3029474"},

Empirical data collected from a survey conducted both in China and Belgium, the total sample consists of 335 Chinese and 197 Belgians. Partial least square with formative assessment was employed to test the proposed model and multi‐groups comparison analysis was conducted to examine the moderation effects of cultural difference on influential factors related to students’ DIL behaviors. The results highlighted the essential role of digital competence and technology expectancy in DIL. Cultural difference revealed a strong influence on the motive pattern of DIL behaviors. This study raised some major implications for educational researchers and practitioners alike. Specifically, the paper introduced and stressed the role of digital competence in informal learning context which was rarely considered in prior studies in terms of learning ecology. The study expanded current theoretical understanding of technology adoption in informal learning environments across different cultural contexts. The finding has shown both a homogeneous informal learning behavior and motive variance between different two cultural backgrounds. The study also provided a set of practical implications, including the need for digital competence training in today’s digital era, and the need for a satisfactory user interface design globally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shihua"}],"citation-key":"heComparativeStudyDigital2019","container-title":"British Journal of Educational Technology","container-title-short":"Brit J Educational Tech","DOI":"10.1111/bjet.12778","ISSN":"0007-1013, 1467-8535","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7]]},"language":"en","page":"1744-1758","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A comparative study of digital informal learning: The effects of digital competence and technology expectancy","title-short":"A comparative study of digital informal learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.12778","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"herbornAssessmentCollaborativeProblem2020","abstract":"Despite the relevance of collaborative problem solving (CPS), there are limited empirical results on the assessment of CPS. In 2015, the large-scale Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) first assessed CPS with virtual tasks requiring participants to collaborate with computer-simulated agents (human-to-agent; H-A). The approach created dynamic CPS situations while standardizing assessment conditions across participating countries. However, H-A approaches are sometimes regarded as poor substitutes for natural collaboration, and only a few studies have identified if the collaborations with agents capture real dynamics of human interactions. To address this, we validated the original PISA 2015 CPS assessment by investigating the effects of replacing computer agents with real students in classroom tests (human-to-human; H-H). We obtained the original PISA 2015 CPS tasks from the OECD and replaced agents with real students to provide more real-life collaboration environments with less control over conversations; the H-H was less constrained than the H-A but still limited by predefined sets of possible answers from which the humans’ would make selections. The interface remained nearly identical to the original PISA 2015 CPS assessment. Students were told the types of collaboration partners, namely humans versus agents. We applied structural equation modeling and multivariate analyses of variance to a sample of 386 students to identify the dimensionality of the CPS construct and compared the effects in CPS performance accuracy and number of behavioral actions. Results indicated no significant differences between type of collaboration partner. However, students performed a larger number of actions when collaborating with a human agent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Herborn","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Stadler","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Mustafić","given":"Maida"},{"family":"Greiff","given":"Samuel"}],"citation-key":"herbornAssessmentCollaborativeProblem2020","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.035","ISSN":"0747-5632","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"105624","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The assessment of collaborative problem solving in PISA 2015: Can computer agents replace humans?","title-short":"The assessment of collaborative problem solving in PISA 2015","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218303571","volume":"104"},

  {"id":"hesseFrameworkTeachableCollaborative2015","abstract":"In his book “Cognition in the Wild”, Hutchins (1995) invites his readers to scan their immediate environment for objects that were not produced through collaborative efforts of several people, and remarks that the only object in his personal environment that passed this test was a small pebble on his desk. In fact, it is remarkable how our daily lives are shaped by collaboration. Whether it is in schools, at the workplace, or in our free time, we are constantly embedded in environments that require us to make use of social skills in order to coordinate with other people. Given the pervasiveness of collaboration in everyday life, it is somewhat surprising that the development of social and collaborative skills is largely regarded as something that will occur naturally and does not require any further facilitation. In fact, groups often fail to make use of their potential (Schulz-Hardt, Brodbeck, Group performance and leadership. In: Hewstone M, Stroebe W, Jonas K (eds) Introduction to social psychology: a European perspective, 4th edn, pp 264–289. Blackwell, Oxford, 2008) and people differ in the extent to which they are capable of collaborating efficiently with others. Therefore, there is a growing awareness that collaborative skills require dedicated teaching efforts (Schoenfeld, Looking toward the 21st century: challenges of educational theory and practice. Edu Res 28:4–14, 1999). Collaborative problem solving has been identified as a particularly promising task that draws upon various social and cognitive skills, and that can be analysed in classroom environments where skills are both measurable and teachable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hesse","given":"Friedrich"},{"family":"Care","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Buder","given":"Juergen"},{"family":"Sassenberg","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"hesseFrameworkTeachableCollaborative2015","collection-title":"Educational Assessment in an Information Age","container-title":"Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills: Methods and Approach","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-017-9395-7_2","editor":[{"family":"Griffin","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Care","given":"Esther"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-017-9395-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"37-56","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Framework for Teachable Collaborative Problem Solving Skills","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9395-7_2"},

Using an interactive environment as a test bed, we are investigating how collaborative creativity can be supported electronically while maintaining face-to-face communication. What are the design-factors influencing such a system? We have designed a brainstorming application that uses an interactive table and a large wall display, and compared the results of using it to traditional paper-based brainstorming in a user study with 30 participants.

Items were initially drawn from the Collaboration Skills Assessment Tool rubric, an educational assessment tool. The SACS measure was piloted in a sample of students in an introductory IPE course. Following scale revision, the SACS was piloted a second time in a sample of students in an IPE health systems course and then validated in a sample of students in an introductory IPE course. Exploratory factor analysis was used to assess scale factor structure in Pilots 1 and 2 and confirmatory factor analysis to confirm factor structure in the validation sample. Convergent and discriminant validity were also assessed. The final SACS measure is an 11-item scale consisting of three dimensions of collaboration: information sharing, learning, and team support. The SACS measure demonstrates high internal consistency and both convergent and discriminant validity as a measure of collaboration. The SACS can be implemented in any setting for assessing collaboration in clinical and nonclinical contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hinyard","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Toomey","given":"Eileen"},{"family":"Eliot","given":"Kathrin"},{"family":"Breitbach","given":"Anthony"}],"citation-key":"hinyardStudentPerceptionsCollaboration2019","container-title":"Evaluation & the Health Professions","container-title-short":"Eval Health Prof","DOI":"10.1177/0163278717752438","ISSN":"0163-2787","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"450-472","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Student Perceptions of Collaboration Skills in an Interprofessional Context: Development and Initial Validation of the Self-Assessed Collaboration Skills Instrument","title-short":"Student Perceptions of Collaboration Skills in an Interprofessional Context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0163278717752438","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"hmelo-silverUnderstandingCollaborativeLearning2008","abstract":"Trying to understand the complexity of computer-mediated problem-based learning environments is not easy. Sociocultural theory provides a theoretical framework for understanding such environments because it emphasizes the socially situated nature of learning and the critical role of tools in mediating learning. To examine how different aspects of discourse relate to each other, as well as to the tools being used in the collaborative learning process, it is important to understand how collaborative knowledge building unfolds and how these processes are mediated. This requires going beyond coding individual speech acts. The use of Chronologically-Ordered Representations of Discourse and Tool-Related Activity (CORDTRA) diagrams is one way of achieving this understanding. We use this to study contrasting cases of more and less successful groups using the STELLAR learning environment. STELLAR is an integrated online PBL environment for preservice teachers, containing a learning sciences hypermedia, a library of videocases, and online personal and collaborative spaces. Our analyses suggest that an important locus of differences is how students use resources and engage in different kinds of metacognitive talk and knowledge transforming activities, sometimes to the group’s detriment. Frequency analyses provided an easily interpreted snapshot of each group’s activity. The CORDTRA analyses provide a more dynamic view that helps researchers and teachers better understand how collaborative learning unfolds. Such analyses have implications for understanding new learning environments as well as helping identify where interventions might be needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hmelo-Silver","given":"Cindy E."},{"family":"Chernobilsky","given":"Ellina"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"hmelo-silverUnderstandingCollaborativeLearning2008","container-title":"Instructional Science","container-title-short":"Instr Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s11251-008-9063-8","ISSN":"1573-1952","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"409-430","source":"Springer Link","title":"Understanding collaborative learning processes in new learning environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11251-008-9063-8","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"hughesSavingLivesMetaanalysis2016","abstract":"As the nature of work becomes more complex, teams have become necessary to ensure effective functioning within organizations. The healthcare industry is no exception. As such, the prevalence of training interventions designed to optimize teamwork in this industry has increased substantially over the last 10 years (Weaver, Dy, & Rosen, 2014). Using Kirkpatrick's (1956, 1996) training evaluation framework, we conducted a meta-analytic examination of healthcare team training to quantify its effectiveness and understand the conditions under which it is most successful. Results demonstrate that healthcare team training improves each of Kirkpatrick's criteria (reactions, learning, transfer, results; d = .37 to .89). Second, findings indicate that healthcare team training is largely robust to trainee composition, training strategy, and characteristics of the work environment, with the only exception being the reduced effectiveness of team training programs that involve feedback. As a tertiary goal, we proposed and found empirical support for a sequential model of healthcare team training where team training affects results via learning, which leads to transfer, which increases results. We find support for this sequential model in the healthcare industry (i.e., the current meta-analysis) and in training across all industries (i.e., using meta-analytic estimates from Arthur, Bennett, Edens, & Bell, 2003), suggesting the sequential benefits of training are not unique to medical teams. Ultimately, this meta-analysis supports the expanded use of team training and points toward recommendations for optimizing its effectiveness within healthcare settings.

  {"id":"ishiiAnalyzingGazeBehavior2018","abstract":"We explored the gaze behavior towards the end of utterances and dialogue act (DA), i.e., verbal-behavior information indicating the intension of an utterance, during turn-keeping/changing to estimate empathy skill levels in multiparty discussions. This is the first attempt to explore the relationship between such a combination. First, we collected data on Davis' Interpersonal Reactivity Index (which measures empathy skill level), utterances that include the DA categories of Provision, Self-disclosure, Empathy, Turn-yielding, and Others, and gaze behavior from participants in four-person discussions. The results of analysis indicate that the gaze behavior accompanying utterances that include these DA categories during turn-keeping/changing differs in accordance with people's empathy skill levels. The most noteworthy result was that speakers with low empathy skill levels tend to avoid making eye contact with the listener when the DA category is Self-disclosure during turn-keeping. However, they tend to maintain eye contact when the DA category is Empathy. A listener who has a high empathy skill level often looks away from the speaker during turn-changing when the DA category of a speaker's utterance is Provision or Empathy. There was also no difference in gaze behavior between empathy skill levels when the DA category of the speaker's utterance was turn-yielding. From these findings, we constructed and evaluated models for estimating empathy skill level using gaze behavior and DA information. The evaluation results indicate that using both gaze behavior and DA during turn-keeping/changing is effective for estimating an individual's empathy skill level in multi-party discussions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ishii","given":"Ryo"},{"family":"Otsuka","given":"Kazuhiro"},{"family":"Kumano","given":"Shiro"},{"family":"Higashinaka","given":"Ryuichiro"},{"family":"Tomita","given":"Junji"}],"citation-key":"ishiiAnalyzingGazeBehavior2018","collection-title":"ICMI '18","container-title":"Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction","DOI":"10.1145/3242969.3242978","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-5692-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,2]]},"page":"31–39","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Analyzing Gaze Behavior and Dialogue Act during Turn-taking for Estimating Empathy Skill Level","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3242969.3242978"},

Few studies have investigated how participation in social interaction ﬂuctuates in relation to these varying types of interaction. The aim of this process-oriented study was to explore how actively students participated in cognitive and socio-emotional interactions and what characterized the moments when participation changed during transitions between the types of interaction. The qualitative analysis focused on video-recorded collaborative learning of six groups of student teachers (N = 24). We found that socio-emotional interaction involved more active participation than cognitive interaction. Changes in participation during transitions between types of interaction were characterized by shifts between domain-focused and metacognitive activities. Implications for supporting and studying productive social interaction in collaborative learning are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Isohätälä","given":"Jaana"},{"family":"Näykki","given":"Piia"},{"family":"Järvelä","given":"Sanna"}],"citation-key":"isohatalaCognitiveSocioEmotionalInteraction2020","container-title":"Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research","container-title-short":"Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research","DOI":"10.1080/00313831.2019.1623310","ISSN":"0031-3831, 1470-1170","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,18]]},"language":"en","page":"831-851","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cognitive and Socio-Emotional Interaction in Collaborative Learning: Exploring Fluctuations in Students’ Participation","title-short":"Cognitive and Socio-Emotional Interaction in Collaborative Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00313831.2019.1623310","volume":"64"},

We then rely on probabilistic topic modeling of the interaction descriptors which, in a fully unsupervised way, is able to discover group interaction patterns that resemble prototypical leadership styles proposed in social psychology.

In this paper, we present a systematic study on dominance modeling in group meetings from fully automatic nonverbal activity cues, in a multicamera, multi-microphone setting. We investigate efﬁcient audio and visual activity cues for the characterization of dominant behavior, analyzing single and joint modalities. Unsupervised and supervised approaches for dominance modeling are also investigated. Activity cues and models are objectively evaluated on a set of dominance-related classiﬁcation tasks, derived from an analysis of the variability of human judgment of perceived dominance in group discussions. Our investigation highlights the power of relatively simple yet efﬁcient approaches and the challenges of audio-visual integration.

  {"id":"jensenGettingRealInterprofessional2023","abstract":"Collaboration between healthcare providers helps tackle the increasing complexity of healthcare. When learning teamwork, interprofessional students are expected to work patient-centered; recognizing the patient's expertise and partnering with them. Research on interprofessional education (IPE) for undergraduates has illuminated learning outcomes, organization of learning activities, change in attitudes, etc. But, we know little about the interaction between patients and interprofessional student teams. This study aimed to explore how interprofessional student teams and patients interact in interprofessional clinical placements. With a focused ethnographic approach, participant observation and qualitative interviews were conducted in two contexts; a physical and an online arrangement. Central ideas in Goffman's dramaturgy constituted a theoretical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis generated three themes: (1) Preparing safe and comfortable encounters with patients, (2) Including and excluding the patient in the encounter, and (3) Adjusting to the patient's situation. We identified students' intentions of patient-centeredness when preparing encounters, but patients did not always feel included and listened to in encounters. After encountering patients, student teams adjusted their teamwork, by changing the team composition or the planned clinical interventions to better meet the patients' needs. Notably, team-based patient encounters led to a different view of the patient, their health issues, and how to collaborate. Our findings can inform educators of the importance of addressing patient-centered care in interprofessional learning arrangements. Today, clinical interprofessional placements may not exploit the potential for learning about patient-centeredness. A thematization of this, e.g., in supervision in future clinical placements can ensure an enhanced focus on this in interprofessional teamwork.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Jensen","given":"Catrine Buck"},{"family":"Norbye","given":"Bente"},{"family":"Dahlgren","given":"Madeleine Abrandt"},{"family":"Iversen","given":"Anita"}],"citation-key":"jensenGettingRealInterprofessional2023","container-title":"ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION","container-title-short":"Adv.

Research has shown that the effectiveness of collaborative learning largely depends on the quality of student interaction. We therefore focus on what a teacher can do to foster student interaction. First, we present a framework that draws a comprehensive picture of a teacher role we see as germane to fostering student interaction. The framework distinguishes between five teacher competencies that span across all implementation phases of collaborative learning: the ability to plan student interaction, monitor, support, and consolidate this interaction, and finally reflect upon it. Then, we review research on collaborative learning and structure this review along the five teacher competencies presented in the framework. The review targets relevant concepts and pivotal empirical research results about how to foster student interaction. For each competency, we first summarize relevant concepts and empirical results. We then apply the concepts and findings to a classroom situation. These teaching vignettes illustrate the functions of the five teacher competencies in fostering student interaction in collaborative learning. For each vignette, we discuss and highlight specific aspects of the presented teacher role and draw practical implications. Monitoring and supporting in the classroom should be trained in teacher education and facilitated by providing teachers with tools such as a checklist of beneficial student behaviors. These practical implications can inform educational practices and offer new directions for future research regarding promoting collaborative learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaendler","given":"Celia"},{"family":"Wiedmann","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Rummel","given":"Nikol"},{"family":"Spada","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"kaendlerTeacherCompetenciesImplementation2015","container-title":"Educational Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Educ Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s10648-014-9288-9","ISSN":"1573-336X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"505-536","source":"Springer Link","title":"Teacher Competencies for the Implementation of Collaborative Learning in the Classroom: a Framework and Research Review","title-short":"Teacher Competencies for the Implementation of Collaborative Learning in the Classroom","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-014-9288-9","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"kangUnveilingJointAttention2024","abstract":"Numerous computer-based collaborative learning environments have been developed to support collaborative problem-solving. Yet, understanding the complexity and dynamic nature of the collaboration process remains a challenge. This is particularly true in open-ended immersive learning environments, where students navigate both physical and virtual spaces, pursuing diverse paths to solve problems. In response, we aimed to unpack these complex collaborative learning processes by investigating 16 groups of college students (n = 77) who utilized an immersive astronomy simulation in their introductory astronomy course. Our specific focus is on joint attention as a multi-level indicator to index collaboration. To examine the interplay between joint attention and other multimodal traces (conceptual discussions and gestures) in students’ interactions with peers and the simulation, we employed a multi-granular approach. This approach encompasses macro-level correlations, meso-level network trends, and micro-level qualitative insights from vignettes to capture nuances at different levels. Distinct multimodal engagement patterns emerged between low- and high-achieving groups, evolving over time across a series of tasks. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the notion of timely joint attention and emphasize the importance of individual exploration during the early stages of collaborative problem-solving, demonstrating its contribution to productive knowledge coconstruction. This research overall provides valuable insights into the complexities of collabo­ ration dynamics within and beyond digital space. The empirical evidence we present in our study lays a strong foundation for developing instructional designs aimed at fostering productive collaboration in immersive learning environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"Jina"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yiqiu"},{"family":"Rajarathinam","given":"Robin Jephthah"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Yuanru"},{"family":"Shaffer","given":"David Williamson"}],"citation-key":"kangUnveilingJointAttention2024","container-title":"Computers & Education","container-title-short":"Computers & Education","DOI":"10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105002","ISSN":"03601315","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5]]},"language":"en","page":"105002","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Unveiling joint attention dynamics: Examining multimodal engagement in an immersive collaborative astronomy simulation","title-short":"Unveiling joint attention dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360131524000162","volume":"213"},

  {"id":"kasepaluTeacherArtificialIntelligenceSupported2022","abstract":"Orchestrating collaborative learning (CL) is difficult for teachers as it involves being aware of multiple simultaneous classroom events and intervening when needed. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology might support the teachers’ pedagogical actions during CL by helping detect students in need and providing suggestions for intervention. This would be resulting in AI and teacher co-orchestrating CL; the effectiveness of which, however, is still in question. This study explores whether having an AI assistant helping the teacher in orchestrating a CL classroom is understandable for the teacher and if it affects the teachers’ pedagogical actions, understanding and strategies of coregulation. Twenty in-service teachers were interviewed using a Wizard-of-Oz protocol. Teachers were asked to identify problems during the CL of groups of students (shown as videos), proposed how they would intervene, and later received (and evaluated) the pedagogical actions suggested by an AI assistant. Our mixed-methods analysis showed that the teachers found the AI assistant useful. Moreover, in multiple cases the teachers started employing the pedagogical actions the AI assistant had introduced to them. Furthermore, an increased number of coregulation methods were employed. Our analysis also explores the extent to which teachers’ expertise is associated with their understanding of coregulation, e.g., less experienced teachers did not see coregulation as part of a teacher’s responsibility, while more experienced teachers did.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Kasepalu","given":"Reet"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Luis P."},{"family":"Ley","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Chejara","given":"Pankaj"}],"citation-key":"kasepaluTeacherArtificialIntelligenceSupported2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Education","DOI":"10.3389/feduc.2022.736194","ISSN":"2504-284X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Teacher Artificial Intelligence-Supported Pedagogical Actions in Collaborative Learning Coregulation: A Wizard-of-Oz Study","title-short":"Teacher Artificial Intelligence-Supported Pedagogical Actions in Collaborative Learning Coregulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feduc.2022.736194","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"kayMiningPatternsEvents2006","abstract":"It is difficult, but very important, to learn to work effectively as part of a team. One potentially invaluable source of information about the success, or problems, in the way that teams learn can be drawn from the electronic traces of their collaborations. The paper describes data mining of student group interaction data to identify significant sequences of activity. Our goal is to build tools that can flag interaction sequences indicative of problems, so that we can use these to assist student teams in early recognition of problems. We also want tools that can identify patterns that are markers of success so that these might indicate improvements during the learning process. Our first challenge is to transform the raw data available in large quantities, preprocessing it into a suitable alphabet for use in data mining. Then, we need data mining algorithms that can properly account for the temporal nature of the data and the character of group interaction. We envisage that this may involve a two way process, where theories of effective group behaviour can drive the data mining and, in the opposite direction, that the data mining should provide results that are meaningful to groups wishing to improve their effectiveness. We report the results of our work in the context of a semester long software development project course.","author":[{"family":"Kay","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Maisonneuve","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Yacef","given":"Kalina"},{"family":"Za","given":"Osmar"}],"citation-key":"kayMiningPatternsEvents2006","container-title":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Educational Data Mining at the 8th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS 2006)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"45-52","source":"Zotero","title":"Mining patterns of events in students’ teamwork data","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"kentInvestigatingCollaborationProcess2020","abstract":"Although collaboration is considered a key 21st-century skill, oftentimes it is only assessed through the outcome measures of individual learners. In this paper, we draw upon collaborative cognitive load theory (CCLT) to explain the process of collaboration in learning from the point of view of the collective, rather than an individual learner. Using CCLT we suggest a new method of measuring the process of collaboration regardless of its outcome measures. Our approach — Collaborative Learning as a Process (CLaP) — uses social network analysis to evaluate the balance between interactivity gains and coordination costs of learner communities. Here, we demonstrate the approach using real-world data derived from the digital tracks of two online discussion communities. We argue that our conceptual approach can enable instructors and learners to unlock the black box of collaboration in learning. It has the potential to support the development of learner skills that go beyond cognition. We conclude the paper with the results of our investigation of the value of the approach to the online module instructor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kent","given":"Carmel"},{"family":"Cukurova","given":"Mutlu"}],"citation-key":"kentInvestigatingCollaborationProcess2020","container-title":"Journal of Learning Analytics","DOI":"10.18608/jla.2020.71.5","ISSN":"1929-7750","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"59-71","source":"oro.open.ac.uk","title":"Investigating Collaboration as a Process with Theory-driven Learning Analytics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://oro.open.ac.uk/80283/","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"kidronBoundaryBreakingInterdisciplinary2015","abstract":"The purpose of this work is to contribute to the body of knowledge on processes by which students develop interdisciplinary understanding of contents, as well as to suggest technology-enhanced means for supporting them in these processes in the context of higher education. In doing so, we suggest a rethinking of three traditional practices that tend to characterise typical higher education instruction: (1) compartmentalisation of disciplines; (2) traditional pedagogy; and (3) traditional hierarchies based on levels of expertise. Our high-level conjecture was that meaningful dialogue with peers and experts supports both the deepening of ideas in one knowledge domain and the formation of connections between ideas from several domains, both of which are required for the development of interdisciplinary understanding. We developed the Boundary Breaking for Interdisciplinary Learning (BBIL) model, which harnesses technology to break boundaries between disciplines, learners and organisational levels of hierarchy. Findings indicate that 36 undergraduate students who participated in an interdisciplinary online course that implemented the BBIL model have significantly improved their interdisciplinary understanding of the course contents. This study illustrates how innovative use of available, free and low-cost technology can produce a ‘positive disruption’ in higher education instruction.Keywords: interdisciplinary learning; interdisciplinary understanding; learning community; cognitive apprenticeship; technology-enhanced learning; instructional design; higher education; online education(Published: 28 October 2015)Citation: Research in Learning Technology 2015, 23: 26496 - http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/rlt.v23.26496","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Kidron","given":"Adi"},{"family":"Kali","given":"Yael"}],"citation-key":"kidronBoundaryBreakingInterdisciplinary2015","container-title":"Research in Learning Technology","DOI":"10.3402/rlt.v23.26496","ISSN":"2156-7077","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,28]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2015","source":"journal.alt.ac.uk","title":"Boundary breaking for interdisciplinary learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journal.alt.ac.uk/index.php/rlt/article/view/1646","volume":"23"},

In a study on brainstorming and problem solving meetings, MM had a significant effect on overlapping speaking time and interactivity level without distracting the subjects. The Sociometric badges were also able to detect dominant players in the group and measure their influence on other participants. Most interestingly, in groups with one or more dominant people, MM effectively reduced the dynamical difference between co-located and distributed collaboration as well as the behavioral difference between dominant and non-dominant people. Our system encourages change in group dynamics that may lead to higher performance and satisfaction. We envision that MM will be deployed in real-world organizations to improve interactions across various group collaboration contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Taemie"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Agnes"},{"family":"Holland","given":"Lindsey"},{"family":"Pentland","given":"Alex Sandy"}],"citation-key":"kimMeetingMediatorEnhancing2008","collection-title":"CSCW '08","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2008 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work","DOI":"10/c3hrtq","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-60558-007-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"457–466","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Meeting mediator: enhancing group collaborationusing sociometric feedback","title-short":"Meeting mediator","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/1460563.1460636"},

  {"id":"kirschnerCognitiveLoadTheory2018","abstract":"Cognitive load theory has traditionally been associated with individual learning. Based on evolutionary educational psychology and our knowledge of human cognition, particularly the relations between working memory and long-term memory, the theory has been used to generate a variety of instructional effects. Though these instructional effects also influence the efficiency and effectiveness of collaborative learning, be it computer supported or face-to-face, they are often not considered either when designing collaborative learning situations/environments or researching collaborative learning. One reason for this omission is that cognitive load theory has only sporadically concerned itself with certain particulars of collaborative learning such as the concept of a collective working memory when collaborating along with issues associated with transactive activities and their concomitant costs which are inherent to collaboration. We illustrate how and why cognitive load theory, by adding these concepts, can throw light on collaborative learning and generate principles specific to the design and study of collaborative learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirschner","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Sweller","given":"John"},{"family":"Kirschner","given":"Femke"},{"family":"Zambrano R.","given":"Jimmy"}],"citation-key":"kirschnerCognitiveLoadTheory2018","container-title":"International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning","container-title-short":"Intern.

This can make it difficult for educators to imagine how data can be used in the classroom, and in turn diminishes the promise of LA as an enabler for encouraging important skills such as sense-making, metacognition, and reflection. We propose two learning design patterns that will help educators to incorporate LA into their teaching protocols: do-analyse-change-reflect, and active learning squared. We discuss these patterns with reference to a case study utilising the Connected Learning Analytics (CLA) toolkit, in three trials run over a period of 18 months.

  {"id":"kohPedagogicalFrameworkLearning2016","abstract":"Many pedagogical models in the field of learning analytics are implicit and do not overtly direct learner behavior. While this allows flexibility of use, this could also result in misaligned practice, and there are calls for more explicit pedagogical models in learning analytics. This paper presents an explicit pedagogical model, the Team and Self Diagnostic Learning (TSDL) framework, in the context of collaborative inquiry tasks. Key informing theories include experiential learning, collaborative learning, and the learning analytics process model. The framework was trialed through a teamwork competency awareness program for 14 year old students. A total of 272 students participated in the program. This paper foregrounds students’ and teachers’ evaluative accounts of the program. Findings reveal positive perceptions of the stages of the TSDL framework, despite identified challenges, which points to its potential usefulness for teaching and learning. The TSDL framework aims to provide theoretical clarity of the learning process, and foster alignment between learning analytics and the learning design. The current work provides trial outcomes of a teamwork competency awareness program that used dispositional analytics, and further efforts are underway to develop the discourse layer of the analytic engine. Future work will also be dedicated to application and refinement of the framework for other contexts and participants, both learners and teachers alike.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Koh","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Shibani","given":"Antonette"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Jennifer Pei-Ling"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Helen"}],"citation-key":"kohPedagogicalFrameworkLearning2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge - LAK '16","DOI":"10.1145/2883851.2883914","event-place":"Edinburgh, United Kingdom","event-title":"the Sixth International Conference","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4190-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"74-83","publisher":"ACM Press","publisher-place":"Edinburgh, United Kingdom","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A pedagogical framework for learning analytics in collaborative inquiry tasks: an example from a teamwork competency awareness program","title-short":"A pedagogical framework for learning analytics in collaborative inquiry tasks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2883851.2883914"},

We conducted our study in an authentic higher-education physics context where computer-supported collaborative inquiry-based learning (CSCIL) is a popular pedagogical approach. Since learners' needs for support in CSCIL vary in the different inquiry phases (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, and discussion), we studied, first, how the coding accuracy of five computational models (based on word embeddings and deep neural networks with attention layers) differed in the various inquiry-based learning (IBL) phases when compared to human coding. Second, we investigated how the different features of the best performing computational model improved the coding accuracy. The study indicated that the accuracy of the best performing computational model (differentiated attention with pre-trained static embeddings) was slightly better than that of the human coder (58.9% vs. 54.3%). We also found that considering the previous and following utterances, as well as the relative position of the utterance, improved the model's accuracy.

  {"id":"lamsaPotentialTemporalAnalysis2020","abstract":"This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion about analysing the temporal aspects of learning processes in the educational technology research field. Our main aim was to advance methods for analysing temporal aspects of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) processes by introducing the temporal lag sequential analysis (TLSA) technique and by combining TLSA with temporal log data analysis (TLDA). Our secondary aim was to illustrate the potential of these two analysis techniques to reveal the differences between the face-to-face technology-enhanced collaborative inquiry-based learning (CIBL) processes of three different conditions (non-scaffolded, writing scaffolded and script scaffolded groups). The study involved undergraduate university students (N = 231) in natural sciences. The TLDA was based on timestamps and groups' inputs into a TEL environment, and it focused on the groups' temporal ways of using technological resources. The TLSA was based on screen capture videos and audio recordings of the groups' CIBL processes, and it focused on the inquiry-based learning (IBL) transition patterns (i.e. the transitions between the different IBL phases) discovered by lag sequential analysis and demonstrated by how the IBL transition patterns temporarily emerged. The TLDA findings demonstrated temporal differences regarding how the groups in the different conditions used the available technological resources. The TLSA findings revealed three temporarily distinct IBL transition pattern clusters whose content and temporal emergence varied depending on the condition. Parallel temporal analysis of the log data and the IBL transition patterns indicated that the use of the technological resources temporarily mediated IBL transition patterns. Specifically, we found advantages similar to those of asynchronous online discussions (think before acting) when face-to-face interaction was enhanced with the writing scaffold.

  {"id":"levyDesigningInquiryBased2009","abstract":"Abstract \n            This paper explores the relationship between practitioners' pedagogical purposes, values and practices in designing for inquiry‐based learning in higher education, and the affordances of the Learning Activity Management System (LAMS) as a tool for creating learning designs in this context. Using a qualitative research methodology, variation was identified in participants' conceptions of inquiry‐based learning pedagogy and in their approaches to inquiry‐based learning design.

Data were obtained from health and social care students (n = 1440, response rate 42.8%) participating in 12 different interprofessional courses in seven education institutions in Norway using a cross-sectional design. Exploratory factor analysis indicated one retracted factor for pre-scores and one retracted factor for post-scores. High McDonald’s omega values indicated good internal consistency. Item deletion did not improve the scale’s overall consistency on pre- or post-scores. We observed higher mean post-scores than pre-scores with moderate-to-large effect sizes, indicating a positive change in self-assessed interprofessional capabilities after training. Our findings indicate that the Norwegian version of ICCAS is a valid tool that may be implemented across a wide range of interprofessional education courses.

This study explored students’ hand movement patterns during the different types of knowledge co-construction discourses: quick consensus-building, integration-oriented consensus building, and conflict-oriented consensus building. Students’ verbal discussion transcripts were qualitatively analyzed to identify the type of knowledge co-construction discourses. Students’ hand motion was video-recorded, and their hand landmarks were detected using the machine learning tool MediaPipe. One-way ANOVA was conducted to compare students hand motions in different types of discourses. The results found there were different hand motion patterns in different types of collaboration discourses. Students tended to employ more hand motion during conflict-oriented consensus building discourses than during quick consensus building and integration-oriented consensus building discourses. At the group level, the collaborating students were found to present less equal hand movement during quick consensus-building than integration-oriented consensus building and conflict-oriented consensus building. The findings expand the existing understanding of embodied collaborative learning, providing insights for optimizing collaborative learning activities incorporating both verbal and non-verbal language.","author":[{"family":"Lyu","given":"Qianru"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Wenli"},{"family":"Su","given":"Junzhu"},{"family":"Heng","given":"Kok Hui John Gerard"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shuai"}],"citation-key":"lyuHowPeersCommunicate2023","container-title":"Artificial Intelligence in Education","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-36272-9_26","editor":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Rebolledo-Mendez","given":"Genaro"},{"family":"Matsuda","given":"Noboru"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Olga C."},{"family":"Dimitrova","given":"Vania"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-36272-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"316-326","publisher":"Springer Nature Switzerland","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"How Peers Communicate Without Words-An Exploratory Study of Hand Movements in Collaborative Learning Using Computer-Vision-Based Body Recognition Techniques","type":"paper-conference"},

To improve on this skill education programmes in both hospital and tertiary settings are increasingly turning to simulation modalities when training undergraduate and registered nurses. The roles simulated patients (SPs) assume can vary according to training purposes and approach.\nAims\nThe first aim is to analyse how SPs are used in nursing education to develop communication skills. The second aim is to evaluate the evidence that is available to support the efficacy of using SPs for training nurses in communication skills and finally to review the SP recruitment and training procedure.\nDesign\nAn Integrative review.\nData Sources\nA search was conducted on CINAHL, Psych-info, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Ovid, Medline, and ProQuest databases. Keywords and inclusion/exclusion criteria were determined and applied to the search strategy.\nReview Methods\nThe integrative review included Nineteen studies from 2006‐2016. Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) method of evaluation was utilised. Emergent themes were extracted with similar and divergent perspectives.\nResults\nAnalysis identified seven clinical contexts for communication skills training (CST) and two SP roles from the eighteen studies. SPs were either directly involved in the teaching of communication (active role) or used in the evaluation of the effectiveness of a communication skills program (passive role). A majority of studies utilised faculty-designed measurement instruments.\nConclusion\nThe evidence presented in the 19 articles indicates that the use of SPs to teach nurse-patient communication skills targets more challenging clinical interactions. Engaging SPs in both CST program facilitation and course evaluation provides nurse educators with a strong foundation to develop further pedagogical and research capacity. Expanding the utilisation of SPs to augment nurses' communication skills and ability to engage with patients in a broader range of clinical contexts with increased methodological rigor is recommended.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"MacLean","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Geddes","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Della","given":"Phillip"}],"citation-key":"macleanUseSimulatedPatients2017","container-title":"Nurse Education Today","container-title-short":"Nurse Education Today","DOI":"10.1016/j.nedt.2016.09.018","ISSN":"0260-6917","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"90-98","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Use of simulated patients to develop communication skills in nursing education: An integrative review","title-short":"Use of simulated patients to develop communication skills in nursing education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026069171630212X","volume":"48"},

In this paper, we describe an approach for rapport detection in peer tutoring, using temporal association rules learned from nonverbal, social, and on-task verbal behaviors. From a corpus of 60 hours of annotated multimodal peer tutoring data, we learn the temporal association between behaviors and the rapport score for each 30-second \"thin-slice\". We then train a stacked ensemble classification model on those association rules and evaluate our ability to reliably predict rapport using multimodal behavioral data. We find that our approach allows us to predict rapport well above chance, and more accurately than two baseline models. We are able to predict high rapport more accurately for strangers and low rapport more accurately for friends, which we believe holds promise for the integration of rapport detection into collaborative learning supports and intelligent tutoring systems.

  {"id":"maDetectingImpasseCollaborative2022","abstract":"Collaborative problem solving has numerous benefits for learners, such as improving higher-level reasoning and developing critical thinking. While learners engage in collaborative activities, they often experience impasse, a potentially brief encounter with differing opinions or insufficient ideas to progress. Impasses provide valuable opportunities for learners to critically discuss the problem and re-evaluate their existing knowledge. Yet, despite the increasing research efforts on developing multimodal modeling techniques to analyze collaborative problem solving, there is limited research on detecting impasse in collaboration. This paper investigates multimodal detection of impasse by analyzing 46 middle school learners’ collaborative dialogue—including speech and facial behaviors—during a coding task. We found that the semantics and speaker information in the linguistic modality, the pitch variation in the audio modality, and the facial muscle movements in the video modality are the most significant unimodal indicators of impasse. We also trained several multimodal models and found that combining indicators from these three modalities provided the best impasse detection performance. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore multimodal modeling of impasse during the collaborative problem solving process. This line of research contributes to the development of real-time adaptive support for collaboration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Yingbo"},{"family":"Celepkolu","given":"Mehmet"},{"family":"Boyer","given":"Kristy Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"maDetectingImpasseCollaborative2022","collection-title":"LAK22","container-title":"LAK22: 12th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3506860.3506865","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9573-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"45–55","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Detecting Impasse During Collaborative Problem Solving with Multimodal Learning Analytics","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3506860.3506865"},

This research addresses the question of how to integrate this bottom-up approach of mining behavioural patterns with the traditional top-down approach of using validated self-reporting instruments. Using process mining, we extracted interaction sequences from ﬁne-grained behavioural traces for 3458 learners across three Massive Open Online Courses. We identiﬁed six distinct interaction sequence patterns. We matched each interaction sequence pattern with one or more theory-based SRL strategies and identiﬁed three clusters of learners. First, Comprehensive Learners, who follow the sequential structure of the course materials, which sets them up for gaining a deeper understanding of the content. Second, Targeting Learners, who strategically engage with speciﬁc course content that will help them pass the assessments. Third, Sampling Learners, who exhibit more erratic and less goal-oriented behaviour, report lower SRL, and underperform relative to both Comprehensive and Targeting Learners.

Empatica sensors were used to capture episodes of simultaneous arousal, and video observations were used to contextualize working phases and types of interaction. Facial expression data were created by post-processing video-recorded data. The results show that simultaneous arousal episodes occurred throughout phases of collaborative learning and the learners presented the most negative facial expressions during the simultaneous arousal episodes. Most of the collaborative interaction during simultaneous arousal was low-level, and regulated learning was not observable. However, when the interaction was high-level, markers of regulated learning were present; when the interaction was confused, it included monitoring activities. This study represents an advance in testing new methods for the objective measurement of social interaction and regulated learning in collaborative contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Malmberg","given":"Jonna"},{"family":"Järvelä","given":"Sanna"},{"family":"Holappa","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Haataja","given":"Eetu"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Xiaohua"},{"family":"Siipo","given":"Antti"}],"citation-key":"malmbergGoingWhatVisible2019","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.030","ISSN":"0747-5632","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"235-245","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Going beyond what is visible: What multichannel data can reveal about interaction in the context of collaborative learning?","title-short":"Going beyond what is visible","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218303078","volume":"96"},

This essay argues that something more radical is happening here than simply attempts to move tests from the laboratory into social settings. The challenge that a new sociology of testing must address is that ubiquitous testing changes the relations between science, engineering, and sociology: Engineering is today in the very stuff of where society happens. It is not that the tests of 21st‐century engineering occur within a social context but that it is the very fabric of the social that is being put to the test. To understand how testing and the social relate today, we must investigate how testing operates \n              on \n              social life, through the modification of its settings. One way to clarify the difference is to say that the new forms of testing can be captured neither within the logic of the field test nor of the controlled experiment. Whereas tests once happened inside social environments, today’s tests directly and deliberately modify the social environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Marres","given":"Noortje"},{"family":"Stark","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"marresPutTestNew2020","container-title":"The British Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"British Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1111/1468-4446.12746","ISSN":"0007-1315, 1468-4446","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"en","page":"423-443","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Put to the test: For a new sociology of testing","title-short":"Put to the test","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-4446.12746","volume":"71"},

However, authentic activities in these multi-surface spaces can be complex. Groups commonly use digital and non-digital artefacts, tools and resources, in varied ways depending on their specific social and epistemic goals. Thus, designing for collaboration in such spaces can be very challenging. Importantly, there is still a lack of agreement on how to approach the analysis of groups' experiences in these heterogeneous spaces. This paper presents an actionable approach that aims to address the complexity of understanding multi-user multi-surface systems. We provide a structure for applying different analytical tools in terms of four closely related dimensions of user activity: the setting, the tasks, the people and the runtime co-configuration.

In this paper, we explored the potential of an enriched tabletop to automatically and unobtrusively capture data from collaborative interactions. By analyzing that data, there was the potential to discover trends in students’ activity. These can help researchers, and eventually teachers, to become aware of the strategies followed by groups. We explored whether it was possible to differentiate groups, in terms of the extent of collaboration, by identifying the interwoven patterns of students’ speech and their physical actions on the interactive surface. The analysis was validated on a sample of 60 students, working in triads in a concept mapping learning activity.

Emerging technology provides a promising opportunity to make collocated collaboration visible by harnessing data about interactions and then mining and visualizing it. These collocated collaboration analytics can help researchers, designers, and users to understand the complexity of collaboration and to find ways they can support collaboration. This article introduces and motivates a set of principles for mining collocated collaboration data and draws attention to trade-offs that may need to be negotiated en route. We integrate Data Science principles and techniques with the advances in interactive surface devices and sensing technologies. We draw on a 7-year research program that has involved the analysis of six group situations in collocated settings with more than 500 users and a variety of surface technologies, tasks, grouping structures, and domains.

However, curriculum design embedding authentic learning pedagogies has been shown to be supportive of student learning. The challenge in adopting such curriculum design is how to offer situated cognitive learning opportunities on a large scale to increasingly diverse cohorts. This paper is a case study of a blended learning approach introduced into a second year undergraduate law unit to teach negotiation theory and practice to a large cohort of students studying in full-time, part-time, and distance external modes. This innovation was situated in an authentic simulated learning environment created through careful design of a high-fidelity scenario, utilising a narrative depicted by Second Life machinima video and simulated documentation.

Participants appeared signiﬁcantly more uncertain about what they were saying when describing the White suspect than when describing the Black suspect. Participants were also more likely to display ‘‘open’’ posture when describing the Black suspect but ‘‘closed’’ posture (e.g., crossed arms) when describing the White suspect.

One of the predominant methods of analyzing such learning is through qualitative content analysis or interaction analysis. The Interaction Analysis Model (IAM), developed by Gunawardena, Lowe and Anderson which qualitatively examines five levels of social construction of knowledge in online discussions has gained traction among researchers as a viable model for assessing how participants learn from each other. However, analyzing large amounts of textual data using this model can be time consuming. Therefore, this study explores how a social learning analytic method based on text analysis can be used to quantitatively analyze the five levels of knowledge construction stipulated in the IAM. Automating the analysis process will enable researchers and instructors to develop a snapshot of the process of social construction of knowledge in online discussions, and thereby make improvements to discussions to enhance collaborative learning as it unfolds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Megli","given":"Austin C."},{"family":"Fallad-Mendoza","given":"Dayra"},{"family":"Etsitty-Dorame","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Desiderio","given":"Jasmine"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Sanchez","given":"Damian"},{"family":"Flor","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Gunawardena","given":"Charlotte N."}],"citation-key":"megliUsingSocialLearning2024","container-title":"American Journal of Distance Education","DOI":"10.1080/08923647.2023.2192597","ISSN":"0892-3647","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,2]]},"page":"65–80","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Using Social Learning Analytic Methods to Examine Social Construction of Knowledge in Online Discussions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08923647.2023.2192597","volume":"38"},

However, defining process characteristics relevant for collaboration quality and developing instruments capable of assessing these characteristics are no trivial tasks. In the assessment method presented in this paper, nine qualitatively defined dimensions of collaboration are rated quantitatively: sustaining mutual understanding, dialogue management, information pooling, reaching consensus, task division, time management, technical coordination, reciprocal interaction, and individual task orientation. The data basis for the development of these dimensions was taken from a study in which students of psychology and medicine collaborated on a complex patient case via a desktop-videoconferencing system. A qualitative content analysis was performed on a sample of transcribed collaboration dialogue. The insights from this analysis were then integrated with theoretical considerations about the roles of communication, joint information processing, coordination, interpersonal relationship, and motivation in the collaboration process. The resulting rating scheme was applied to process data from a new sample of 40 collaborating dyads. Based on positive findings on inter-rater reliability, consistency, and validity from this evaluation, we argue that the new method can be recommended for use in different areas of CSCL.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Meier","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Spada","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Rummel","given":"Nikol"}],"citation-key":"meierRatingSchemeAssessing2007","container-title":"International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning","container-title-short":"Computer Supported Learning","DOI":"10.1007/s11412-006-9005-x","ISSN":"1556-1615","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"63-86","source":"Springer Link","title":"A rating scheme for assessing the quality of computer-supported collaboration processes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11412-006-9005-x","volume":"2"},

We distinguish two concepts of time, namely the passage of time and order in time. Passage of time considers time as a continuous flow of events and order in time focuses on the organization among events. Within the passage of time we distinguish four metrics: position, duration, frequency and rate. Within order in time we discriminate between consistency, recurrent and non-recurrent change and irregular change. Metrics extracted to index passage of time can be used in many different statistical methods, whereas analysis of order in time commonly requires the usage of advanced analysis methods. For either, decisions about the level of granularity at which time is considered and segmentation of time into “windows” have important effects on analysis results. We argue that understanding the value of temporal concepts and implications for the related analysis, is foundational for closing the loop and advancing learning analytics design with temporal insights.","author":[{"family":"Molenaar","given":"Inge"},{"family":"Wise","given":"Alyssa Friend"}],"citation-key":"molenaarChapterTemporalAspects","language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Chapter 7: Temporal Aspects of Learning Analytics - Grounding Analyses in Concepts of Time","type":"article-journal"},

In the present study, we investigate the coordination dynamics of multiple psychophysiological measures and their utility in capturing emotional dynamics in teams. We use data from an experiment where teams of three people built origami boats together in an assembly-line manner while their heart rate, skin conductance, and facial muscle activity were recorded. Our results show that physiological synchrony of skin conductance measures and eletromyographic measures of the corrugator supercilii develops spontaneously among team members during this cooperative production task. Moreover, high team synchrony is found indicative of team cohesion, while low team synchrony is found indicative of a teams' decision to adopt a new behavior across multiple production sessions. We conclude that team-level measures of synchrony offer new and complementary information compared to measures of individual levels of physiological activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Mønster","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Håkonsson","given":"Dorthe Døjbak"},{"family":"Eskildsen","given":"Jacob Kjær"},{"family":"Wallot","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"monsterPhysiologicalEvidenceInterpersonal2016","container-title":"Physiology & Behavior","container-title-short":"Physiology & Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.01.004","ISSN":"0031-9384","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,15]]},"language":"en","page":"24-34","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Physiological evidence of interpersonal dynamics in a cooperative production task","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003193841630004X","volume":"156"},

We record videos of unscripted discussions of three to four people using a multi-view camera system and microphones. We analyse a rich set of non-verbal signals for rapport detection, namely facial expressions, hand motion, gaze, speaker turns, and speech prosody. Using facial features, we can detect low rapport with an average precision of 0.7 (chance level at 0.25), while incorporating prior knowledge of participants' personalities can even achieve early prediction without a drop in performance.

Design plays subtly different roles in each of these models. The learning design research community is shifting its attention from the representation of pedagogical plans to considering design as an ongoing process. As a result, the study of the artefacts generated and used by educational designers is also changing: from a focus on the final designed artefact (the product of the design process) to the many artefacts generated and used by designers at different stages of the design process (e.g., sketches, reflections, drawings, or pictures). However, there is still a dearth of studies exploring the evolution of such artefacts throughout the learning design life cycle. A deeper understanding of these evolutionary processes is needed – to help smooth the transitions between stages in the life cycle. In this paper, we introduce the four-dimensional framework for artefacts in design (4FAD) to generate understanding and facilitate the mapping of the evolution of learning design artefacts.

In this article, the development and validation of a questionnaire for assessing the development of collaborative knowledge work competence is based on object-bound collaborative knowledge creation practices. In total, 546 students responded to a questionnaire on Collaborative Knowledge Practices (CKP). The data were analysed for measurement invariance for two groups of HE students in media engineering and life sciences. Seven scales of the CKP were found to measure course-related learning of collaboration, integration of personal and collective efforts, development through feedback, persistent development of knowledge objects, understanding of different disciplines and related expertise, interdisciplinary collaboration, and using digital technology. The CKP questionnaire scales can be used as a generic self-evaluation tool for students on course-based learning outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Muukkonen","given":"Hanni"},{"family":"Lakkala","given":"Minna"},{"family":"Lahti-Nuuttila","given":"Pekka"},{"family":"Ilomäki","given":"Liisa"},{"family":"Karlgren","given":"Klas"},{"family":"Toom","given":"Auli"}],"citation-key":"muukkonenAssessingDevelopmentCollaborative2020","container-title":"Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research","DOI":"10/gh9jnx","ISSN":"0031-3831","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"page":"1071-1089","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Assessing the Development of Collaborative Knowledge Work Competence: Scales for Higher Education Course Contexts","title-short":"Assessing the Development of Collaborative Knowledge Work Competence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00313831.2019.1647284","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"nakanoPredictingParticipationStyles2015","abstract":"With the goal of assessing participant attitudes and group activities in collaborative learning, this study presents models of participation styles based on co-occurrence patterns of nonverbal behaviors between conversational participants. First, we collected conversations among groups of three people in a collaborative learning situation, wherein each participant had a digital pen and wore a glasses-type eye tracker. We then divided the collected multimodal data into 0.1-second intervals. The discretized data were applied to an unsupervised method to find co-occurrence behavioral patterns. As a result, we discovered 122 multimodal behavioral motifs from more than 3,000 possible combinations of behaviors by three participants. Using the multimodal behavioral motifs as predictor variables, we created regression models for assessing participation styles. The multiple correlation coefficients ranged from 0.74 to 0.84, indicating a good fit between the models and the data. A correlation analysis also enabled us to identify a smaller set of behavioral motifs (fewer than 30) that are statistically significant as predictors of participation styles. These results show that automatically discovered combinations of multiple kinds of nonverbal information with high co-occurrence frequencies observed between multiple participants as well as for a single participant are useful in characterizing the participant's attitudes towards the conversation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Nakano","given":"Yukiko I."},{"family":"Nihonyanagi","given":"Sakiko"},{"family":"Takase","given":"Yutaka"},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Shogo"}],"citation-key":"nakanoPredictingParticipationStyles2015","collection-title":"ICMI '15","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2015 ACM on International Conference on Multimodal Interaction","DOI":"10/gpgpcb","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3912-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"91–98","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Predicting Participation Styles using Co-occurrence Patterns of Nonverbal Behaviors in Collaborative Learning","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/2818346.2820764"},
  {"id":"nasirManyAreWays2021","abstract":"Understanding the way learners engage with learning technologies, and its relation with their learning, is crucial for motivating design of effective learning interventions. Assessing the learners’ state of engagement, however, is non-trivial. Research suggests that performance is not always a good indicator of learning, especially with open-ended constructivist activities. In this paper, we describe a combined multi-modal learning analytics and interaction analysis method that uses video, audio and log data to identify multi-modal collaborative learning behavioral profiles of 32 dyads as they work on an open-ended task around interactive tabletops with a robot mediator. These profiles, which we name Expressive Explorers, Calm Tinkerers, and Silent Wanderers, confirm previous collaborative learning findings. In particular, the amount of speech interaction and the overlap of speech between a pair of learners are behavior patterns that strongly distinguish between learning and non-learning pairs. Delving deeper, findings suggest that overlapping speech between learners can indicate engagement that is conducive to learning. When we more broadly consider learner affect and actions during the task, we are better able to characterize the range of behavioral profiles exhibited among those who learn. Specifically, we discover two behavioral dimensions along which those who learn vary, namely, problem solving strategy (actions) and emotional expressivity (affect). This finding suggests a relation between problem solving strategy and emotional behavior; one strategy leads to more frustration compared to another. These findings have implications for the design of real-time learning interventions that support productive collaborative learning in open-ended tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Nasir","given":"Jauwairia"},{"family":"Kothiyal","given":"Aditi"},{"family":"Bruno","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Dillenbourg","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"nasirManyAreWays2021","container-title":"International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning","container-title-short":"Intern.

  {"id":"nasirTemporalPathwaysLearning2022","abstract":"The learning process depends on the nature of the learning environment, particularly in the case of open-ended learning environments, where the learning process is considered to be non-linear. In this paper, we report on the findings of employing a multimodal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methodology to investigate the temporal learning processes of two types of learners that have learning gains and a type that does not have learning gains in an open-ended collaborative learning activity. Considering log data, speech behavior, affective states and gaze patterns, we find that all learners start from a similar state of non-productivity, but once out of it they are unlikely to fall back into that state, especially in the case of the learners that have learning gains. Those who have learning gains shift between two problem solving strategies, each characterized by both exploratory and reflective actions, as well as demonstrate speech and gaze patterns associated with these strategies, that differ from those who don't have learning gains. Further, the teams that have learning gains also differ between themselves in the manner in which they employ the problem solving strategies over the interaction, as well as in the manner they express negative emotions while exhibiting a particular strategy. These outcomes contribute to understanding the multiple pathways of learning in an open-ended collaborative learning environment, and provide actionable insights for designing effective interventions. © 2022 The Authors","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Nasir","given":"J."},{"family":"Abderrahim","given":"M."},{"family":"Kothiyal","given":"A."},{"family":"Dillenbourg","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"nasirTemporalPathwaysLearning2022","container-title":"Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","container-title-short":"Comput.

We recruited 40 subjects to perform a cooperative-task in gender-matched, two-person teams. They were responsible for working together to meet a common goal, which was to successfully disarm a simulated bomb. This high-workload task requires successful cooperation and communication among members. We assessed several behaviors that relate to facial expression, word choice and physiological responses (i.e., heart rate variability) within this scenario. A manipulation of an â€oeice breakerâ€❝ condition was used to induce a level of comfort or familiarity within the team prior to the task. We found that individuals in the â€oeice breakerâ€❝ condition exhibited better resilience to subjective stress following the task.

  {"id":"nguyenExaminingSociallyShared2023","abstract":"Socially shared regulation contributes to the success of collaborative learning. However, the assessment of socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) faces several challenges in the effort to increase the understanding of collaborative learning and support outcomes due to the unobservability of the related cognitive and emotional processes. The recent development of trace-based assessment has enabled innovative opportunities to overcome the problem. Despite the potential of a trace-based approach to study SSRL, there remains a paucity of evidence on how trace-based evidence could be captured and utilised to assess and promote SSRL. This study aims to investigate the assessment of electrodermal activities (EDA) data to understand and support SSRL in collaborative learning, hence enhancing learning outcomes. The data collection involves secondary school students (N = 94) working collaboratively in groups through five science lessons. A multimodal data set of EDA and video data were examined to assess the relationship among shared arousals and interactions for SSRL. The results of this study inform the patterns among students' physiological activities and their SSRL interactions to provide trace-based evidence for an adaptive and maladaptive pattern of collaborative learning. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence about how trace-based data could be utilised to predict learning outcomes in collaborative learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicSocially shared regulation has been recognised as an essential aspect of collaborative learning success.It is challenging to make the processes of learning regulation ‘visible’ to better understand and support student learning, especially in dynamic collaborative settings.Multimodal learning analytics are showing promise for being a powerful tool to reveal new insights into the temporal and sequential aspects of regulation in collaborative learning.What this paper addsUtilising multimodal big data analytics to reveal the regulatory patterns of shared physiological arousal events (SPAEs) and regulatory activities in collaborative learning.Providing evidence of using multimodal data including physiological signals to indicate trigger events in socially shared regulation.Examining the differences of regulatory patterns between successful and less successful collaborative learning sessions.Demonstrating the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict collaborative learning success by examining regulatory patterns.Implications for practice and/or policyOur findings offer insights into how students regulate their learning during collaborative learning, which can be used to design adaptive supports that can foster students' learning regulation.This study could encourage researchers and practitioners to consider the methodological development incorporating advanced techniques such as AI machine learning for capturing, processing and analysing multimodal data to examine and support learning regulation. © 2022 The Authors.

A pluralist approach highlights that objects perform at least three types of work in this context: they motivate collaboration, they allow participants to work across different types of boundaries, and they constitute the fundamental infrastructure of the activity. Building on the results of an empirical study, we illustrate the insights that each theoretical lens affords into practices of collaboration and develop a novel analytical framework that organizes objects according to the active work they perform. Our framework can help shed new light on the phenomenon, especially with regard to the shifting status of objects and sources of conflict (and change) in collaboration. After discussing these novel insights, we outline directions for future research stemming from a pluralist approach.

One of the software engineering’s approaches, highly used in new industries, is agile development. User stories are a commonly used notation to capture user requirements in agile development. Nevertheless, for the elaboration of user stories, a high level of collaboration with the client is necessary. This professional skill is rarely measured or evaluated in educational contexts. The present work approaches collaboration in software engineering students through multimodal learning analytics, modeling, and evaluating students’ collaboration while they are writing user stories. For that, we used multidirectional microphones in order to derive social network analysis metrics related to collaboration (permanence and prompting) together with human-annotated information (quality of the stories and productivity). Results show that groups with a lower productivity in writing user stories and less professional experience in managing software requirements present a non-collaborative behavior more frequently, and that teams with a fewer number of interventions are more likely to produce a greater number of user stories. Moreover, although low experience subjects produced more user stories, a greater productivity of the most experienced subjects was not statistically verified. We believe that these types of initiatives will allow the measurement and early development of such skills in university students.","author":[{"family":"Noel","given":"Rene"},{"family":"Riquelme","given":"Fabián"},{"family":"Lean","given":"Roberto Mac"},{"family":"Merino","given":"Erick"},{"family":"Cechinel","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Barcelos","given":"Thiago S."},{"family":"Villarroel","given":"Rodolfo"},{"family":"Munoz","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"noelExploringCollaborativeWriting2018","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876801","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"67783-67798","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Exploring Collaborative Writing of User Stories With Multimodal Learning Analytics: A Case Study on a Software Engineering Course","title-short":"Exploring Collaborative Writing of User Stories With Multimodal Learning Analytics","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"nokes-malachEffectExpertiseCollaborative2012","abstract":"Why do some groups succeed where others fail? We hypothesise that collaborative success is achieved when the relationship between the dyad's prior expertise and the complexity of the task creates a situation that affords constructive and interactive processes between group members. We call this state the zone of proximal facilitation in which the dyad's prior knowledge and experience enables them to benefit from both knowledge-based problem-solving processes (e.g., elaboration, explanation, and error correction) andcollaborative skills (e.g., creating common ground, maintaining joint attention to the task). To test this hypothesis we conducted an experiment in which participants with different levels of aviation expertise, experts (flight instructors), novices (student pilots), and non-pilots, read flight problem scenarios of varying complexity and had to identify the problem and generate a solution with either another participant of the same level of expertise or alone. The non-pilots showed collaborative inhibition on problem identification in which dyads performed worse than their predicted potential for both simple and complex scenarios, whereas the novices and experts did not. On solution generation the non-pilot and novice dyads performed at their predicted potential with no collaborative inhibition on either simple or complex scenarios. In contrast, expert dyads showed collaborative gains, withdyads performing above their predicted potential, but only for the complex scenarios. On simple scenarios the expert dyads showed collaborative inhibition and performed worse than their predicted potential. We discuss the implications of these results for theories of collaborative problem solving.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Nokes-Malach","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Meade","given":"Michelle L."},{"family":"Morrow","given":"Daniel G."}],"citation-key":"nokes-malachEffectExpertiseCollaborative2012","container-title":"Thinking & Reasoning","DOI":"10.1080/13546783.2011.642206","ISSN":"1354-6783","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,1]]},"page":"32-58","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The effect of expertise on collaborative problem solving","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13546783.2011.642206","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"norooziMultimodalDataDesign2019","abstract":"The increased interest in multimodal data collection in the learning sciences demands for new and powerful methodological and analytical techniques and technologies. It is especially challenging for learning scientists to handle, analyse, and interpret complex and often invisible multimodal data when investigating regulation of learning in collaborative settings as this data can be cognitive, social and/or emotional in nature, much of which is covert in nature. The aim of this paper is to present ways to simplify the analysis and use of rich multimodal data by learning scientists. This is done by making primarily invisible regulation processes and their accompanying social and contextual reactions visible, measurable, and ultimately interpretable. To facilitate data visualisation and processing with respect to the regulation of learning, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) known as SLAM-KIT has been designed. SLAM-KIT reveals principal features of complex learning environments by allowing users to travel through the learners' data and its statistical characteristics. This kit has practical implications as it simplifies complex information and data while making them available through visualisation and analysis to the researchers. Our short-term goal is to simplify this tool for the teachers and learners.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Noroozi","given":"Omid"},{"family":"Alikhani","given":"Iman"},{"family":"Järvelä","given":"Sanna"},{"family":"Kirschner","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Juuso","given":"Ilkka"},{"family":"Seppänen","given":"Tapio"}],"citation-key":"norooziMultimodalDataDesign2019","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.019","ISSN":"0747-5632","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"298-304","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Multimodal data to design visual learning analytics for understanding regulation of learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218306058","volume":"100"},
  {"id":"nyman-salonenStudyingNonverbalSynchrony2021","abstract":"Research on nonverbal synchrony (movement coordination) in psychotherapy has recently attracted increased attention. Nonverbal synchrony has been shown to relate to the therapeutic alliance and outcome. However, research on nonverbal synchrony in couple therapy remains scarce. In this study, we examined the therapy process of one couple in detail and created a coding scheme to depict posture and movement synchrony. In this case study, we found that the relationship between nonverbal synchrony and the therapeutic alliance was complex. During the therapy process, the amount of nonverbal synchrony varied, as did the participants’ evaluations of the alliance. In couple therapy nonverbal synchrony could affect both the persons involved in it and the persons observing it. In one of the sessions, almost all the synchronies occurred between the female client and one of the therapists, and all except the female client evaluated the alliance to be weaker. In this case study, there were two therapists present, and the co-therapists’ synchrony was found to be important for the male client’s evaluations of the alliance. When there was more synchrony between the therapists, he evaluated the alliance to be stronger. Interestingly, the co-therapists’ synchrony seemed to peak in sessions that succeeded sessions with a weaker alliance, as if the therapists were implicitly making a joint effort to strengthen the alliance. A short episode from one session is given to illustrate the findings. Our coding scheme enables studying nonverbal synchrony (posture and movement synchrony) in couple therapy and combining the research results to other temporally precise data obtained from the sessions. More research is needed to validate the method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Nyman-Salonen","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Tourunen","given":"Anu"},{"family":"Kykyri","given":"Virpi-Liisa"},{"family":"Penttonen","given":"Markku"},{"family":"Kaartinen","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Seikkula","given":"Jaakko"}],"citation-key":"nyman-salonenStudyingNonverbalSynchrony2021","container-title":"Contemporary Family Therapy","container-title-short":"Contemp Fam Ther","DOI":"10.1007/s10591-020-09555-5","ISSN":"1573-3335","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"69-87","publisher":"Springer US","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Studying Nonverbal Synchrony in Couple Therapy—Observing Implicit Posture and Movement Synchrony","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10591-020-09555-5","volume":"43"},

This work processes video, audio and pen strokes information included in the Math Data Corpus, a set of multimodal resources provided to the participants of the Second International Workshop on Multimodal Learning Analytics. The result of this processing is a set of simple features that could discriminate between experts and non-experts in groups of students solving mathematical problems. The main finding is that several of those simple features, namely the percentage of time that the students use the calculator, the speed at which the student writes or draws and the percentage of time that the student mentions numbers or mathematical terms, are good discriminators be- tween experts and non-experts students. Precision levels of 63% are obtained for individual problems and up to 80% when full sessions (aggregation of 16 problems) are analyzed. While the results are specific for the recorded settings, the methodology used to obtain and analyze the features could be used to create discriminations models for other contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ochoa","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Chiluiza","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Méndez","given":"Gonzalo"},{"family":"Luzardo","given":"Gonzalo"},{"family":"Guamán","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Castells","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"ochoaExpertiseEstimationBased2013","collection-title":"ICMI '13","container-title":"Proceedings of the 15th ACM on International conference on multimodal interaction","DOI":"10.1145/2522848.2533789","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2129-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,9]]},"page":"583–590","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Expertise estimation based on simple multimodal features","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/2522848.2533789"},

Our goal is to be able to understand how patterns of behavior shape individuals and organizations. By using on-body sensors in large groups of people for extended periods of time in naturalistic settings, we have been able to identify, measure, and quantify social interactions, group behavior, and organizational dynamics. We deployed this wearable computing platform in a group of 22 employees working in a real organization over a period of one month. Using these automatic measurements, we were able to predict employees' self-assessments of job satisfaction and their own perceptions of group interaction quality by combining data collected with our platform and e-mail communication data. In particular, the total amount of communication was predictive of both of these assessments, and betweenness in the social network exhibited a high negative correlation with group interaction satisfaction. We also found that physical proximity and e-mail exchange had a negative correlation of $r = -0.55\\ (p 0.01)$, which has far-reaching implications for past and future research on social networks.","author":[{"family":"Olguin Olguin","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Waber","given":"Benjamin N."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Taemie"},{"family":"Mohan","given":"Akshay"},{"family":"Ara","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Pentland","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"olguinolguinSensibleOrganizationsTechnology2009","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","DOI":"10/fn23jg","ISSN":"1941-0492","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"43-55","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Sensible Organizations: Technology and Methodology for Automatically Measuring Organizational Behavior","title-short":"Sensible Organizations","type":"article-journal","volume":"39"},

Both multimodal data analysis and temporal analysis have been applied successfully, but in the area of collaborative learning, very few studies have investigated specific advantages of multiple modalities versus a single modality, especially combined with temporal analysis. In this paper, we investigate how both the use of multimodal data and moving from averages and counts to temporal aspects in a collaborative setting provides a better prediction of learning gains. To address these questions, we analyze multimodal data collected from 25 9?11-year-old dyads using a fractions intelligent tutoring system. Assessing the relation of dual gaze, tutor log, audio and dialog data to students' learning gains, we find that a combination of modalities, especially those at a smaller time scale, such as gaze and audio, provides a more accurate prediction of learning gains than models with a single modality. Our work contributes to the understanding of how analyzing multimodal data in temporal manner provides additional information around the collaborative learning process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Olsen","given":"Jennifer K."},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Kshitij"},{"family":"Rummel","given":"Nikol"},{"family":"Aleven","given":"Vincent"}],"citation-key":"olsenTemporalAnalysisMultimodal2020","container-title":"British Journal of Educational Technology","DOI":"10.1111/bjet.12982","ISSN":"0007-1013","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1527-1547","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"bera-journals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.uio.no (Atypon)","title":"Temporal analysis of multimodal data to predict collaborative learning outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://bera.journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12982","volume":"51"},

Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility and extracted data. Results: Thirty-seven articles from twelve different institutions with ITWs were included. ITWs world-wide are organized similarly with groups of 2–12 students (i.e. medical, nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and pharmacy) being involved in patient care, usually for a period of two weeks. However, the type of clinical ward and the way supervisors are trained differ. Conclusions: ITWs show promising results in short-term student learning outcomes and patient satisfaction rates.

In a pilot evaluation, 16 two-person teams performed the task within one of three feedback conditions (Individual, Team, or None) across four trials each. The STT used a unique approach to filtering feedback so that teams in both individual and team conditions received a similar amount of feedback. In one performance measure, Team condition participants made fewer errors in one task than those in other conditions, though at a potential cost of mental workload. Feedback condition also significantly affected participants' subjective rating of both their own performance and their teammate's. This ITTS is one of the first automated team tutoring systems that provided real-time feedback during task execution.

  {"id":"ouyangApplyingMultimodalLearning2022","abstract":"Background: Instructor scaffolding is proved to be an effective means to improve collaborative learning quality, but empirical research indicates discrepancies about the effect of instructor scaffoldings on collaborative programming. Few studies have used multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) to comprehensively analyze the collaborative programming processes from a process-oriented perspective. This research conducts a MMLA research to examine the immediate and delayed effects of instructor scaffoldings on small groups’ collaborative programming in K-12 education context with an aim to provide research, analytics, and pedagogical implications. Results: The results indicated that the instructor provided five types of scaffoldings from the social, cognitive, and metacognitive dimensions, and groups had seven types of responses (i.e., immediate uptake and delayed use) to five instructor scaffoldings, ranging from the low-to-medium and high level of cognitive engagement. After the scaffolding was faded, groups used the content from the high-control cognitive scaffolding frequently to solve problems in a delayed way, but groups did not use the instructor’s scaffolding content from the social and low-control cognitive scaffoldings from the pedagogical perspective, instructors should consider scaffolding types, group states and characteristics, as well as the timing of scaffolding to better design and facilitate collaborative programming. From an analytical perspective, MMLA was proved to be conducive to understand collaborative learning from social, cognitive, behavioral, and micro-level dimensions, such that instructors can better understand and reflect on the process of collaborative learning, and use scaffoldings more skillfully to support collaborative learning. Conclusions: Collaborative programming is encouraged to be integrated in STEM education to transform education from the instructor-directed lecturing to the learner-centered learning. Using MMLA methods, this research provided a deep understanding of the immediate and delayed effects of instructor scaffoldings on small groups’ collaborative programming in K-12 STEM education from a process-oriented perspective. The results showed that various instructor scaffoldings have been used to promote groups’ social and cognitive engagement. Instructor scaffoldings have delayed effects on promoting collaborative programming qualities.

In this research, simultaneous speech was investigated in groups of students as they jointly solved math problems and peer tutored one another. Analyses were based on the Math Data Corpus, which includes ground-truth performance coding and speech transcriptions. Simultaneous speech was elevated 120-143% during the most productive phase of problem solving, compared with matched intervals. It also was elevated 18-37% in students who were domain experts, compared with non-experts. Qualitative analyses revealed that experts differed from non-experts in the function of their interruptions. Analysis of these functional asymmetries produced nine key behaviors that were used to identify the dominant math expert in a group with 95-100% accuracy in three minutes. This research demonstrates that overlapped speech is a marker of group problem-solving progress and domain expertise. It provides valuable information for the emerging field of learning analytics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Oviatt","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Hang","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jianlong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Fang"}],"citation-key":"oviattSpokenInterruptionsSignal2015","collection-title":"ICMI '15","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2015 ACM on International Conference on Multimodal Interaction","DOI":"10.1145/2818346.2820743","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3912-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"311–318","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Spoken Interruptions Signal Productive Problem Solving and Domain Expertise in Mathematics","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/2818346.2820743"},

  {"id":"owensClassroomSoundCan2017","abstract":"Active-learning pedagogies have been repeatedly demonstrated to produce superior learning gains with large effect sizes compared with lecture-based pedagogies. Shifting large numbers of college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty to include any active learning in their teaching may retain and more effectively educate far more students than having a few faculty completely transform their teaching, but the extent to which STEM faculty are changing their teaching methods is unclear. Here, we describe the development and application of the machine-learning–derived algorithm Decibel Analysis for Research in Teaching (DART), which can analyze thousands of hours of STEM course audio recordings quickly, with minimal costs, and without need for human observers. DART analyzes the volume and variance of classroom recordings to predict the quantity of time spent on single voice (e.g., lecture), multiple voice (e.g., pair discussion), and no voice (e.g., clicker question thinking) activities. Applying DART to 1,486 recordings of class sessions from 67 courses, a total of 1,720 h of audio, revealed varied patterns of lecture (single voice) and nonlecture activity (multiple and no voice) use. We also found that there was significantly more use of multiple and no voice strategies in courses for STEM majors compared with courses for non-STEM majors, indicating that DART can be used to compare teaching strategies in different types of courses. Therefore, DART has the potential to systematically inventory the presence of active learning with ∼90% accuracy across thousands of courses in diverse settings with minimal effort.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Owens","given":"Melinda T."},{"family":"Seidel","given":"Shannon B."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Bejines","given":"Travis E."},{"family":"Lietz","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Perez","given":"Joseph R."},{"family":"Sit","given":"Shangheng"},{"family":"Subedar","given":"Zahur-Saleh"},{"family":"Acker","given":"Gigi N."},{"family":"Akana","given":"Susan F."},{"family":"Balukjian","given":"Brad"},{"family":"Benton","given":"Hilary P."},{"family":"Blair","given":"J.

  {"id":"palominosHealthcareStudentsPerceptions2019","abstract":"Background\nResearch literature suggests that learning from mistakes facilitates news insights and leads to professional development. The significant growth in the use of simulation-based learning is premised on the understanding that in this context learners can make and learn from their errors without negatively impacting real patients. However, studies also suggest that making errors can be emotionally detrimental to learners. Given these contradictory findings, this literature review explores learners' views about this phenomenon.\nObjective\nThe objective of this integrated review was to explore healthcare students' perceptions of making errors during simulation-based learning experiences.\nDesign\nWhittemore and Knafl's framework for integrated reviews was used to structure this review.\nData sources\nFive electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and SCOPUS and the search engine Google Scholar were searched. The initial terms used were nursing students, medical students, health professionals, error*, mistake*, and simulation.\nMethods\nThe original search resulted in 2317 potential records. After screening against the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 11 articles were critically appraised using The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist and were included in the review.\nResults\nThe two overarching themes to emerge from the analysis were the impact of errors on learners and the impact of errors on learning.\nConclusion\nDespite the negative feelings experienced by some students regarding making mistakes in simulation, there were key factors that moderated the impact of these feelings and transformed the errors into learning opportunities. These included: the provision of a safe learning environment where constructive feedback was provided by skilled educators, and where students were supported to take responsibility for their mistakes. Although the findings suggest that making mistakes in simulation-based learning can be beneficial, optimising learning from mistakes requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach in which educators plan for and support learners to recognise, acknowledge and respond effectively to errors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Palominos","given":"Evelyn"},{"family":"Levett-Jones","given":"Tracy"},{"family":"Power","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"palominosHealthcareStudentsPerceptions2019","container-title":"Nurse Education Today","container-title-short":"Nurse Education Today","DOI":"10.1016/j.nedt.2019.02.013","ISSN":"0260-6917","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"32-39","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Healthcare students' perceptions and experiences of making errors in simulation: An integrative review","title-short":"Healthcare students' perceptions and experiences of making errors in simulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026069171830577X","volume":"77"},

The form and outcome of the behavioral (encoding) and person perception (decoding) processes are a product of three related elements, including: (1) determinants, (2) the social environment, and (3) cognitive-affective mediators. In this model, the determinants (biology, culture, gender, and personality), in combination with the partner and setting, influence interpersonal expectancies, dispositions, goals, affect, and cognitive resources. In turn, these mediators constrain the attention and cognitive effort applied to behavior management and person perception. In general, fewer cognitive resources and decreased effort will have less effect on the outcome of automatic behavioral (e.g., scripts) and person perception (e.g., impressions based on appearance and nonverbal cues) processes than on more demanding ones. The utility of this theory in integrating behavioral and person perception processes into a single system is discussed.","author":[{"family":"Patterson","given":"Miles"}],"citation-key":"pattersonParallelProcessModel1995","container-title":"Journal of Nonverbal Behavior","container-title-short":"Journal of Nonverbal Behavior","DOI":"10.1007/BF02173410","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",3,1]]},"page":"3-29","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A parallel process model of nonverbal communication","title-short":"Invited article","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

In this study, we propose using multimodal data to design an intelligent monitoring agent that can assist teachers in effectively monitoring the multiple mental states of students during discussion. We firstly developed an advanced multi-sensor-based system and applied it in a real university's research lab to collect a multimodal “in-the-wild” teacher-student conversation dataset. Then, we derived a set of proxy features from facial, heart rate, and acoustic modalities and used them to train several supervised learning classifiers with different multimodal fusion approaches single-channel-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion to recognize students' multiple mental states in conversations. We explored how to design multimodal analytics to augment the ability to recognize different mental states and found that fusing heart rate and acoustic modalities yields better recognize the states of concentration (AUC = 0.842) and confusion (AUC = 0.695), while fusing three modalities yield the best performance in recognizing the states of frustration (AUC = 0.737) and boredom (AUC = 0.810). Our results also explored the possibility of leveraging the advantages of the replacement capabilities between different modalities to provide human teachers with solutions for addressing the challenges with monitoring students in different real-world education environments.","author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Shimeng"},{"family":"Nagao","given":"Katashi"}],"citation-key":"pengRecognitionStudentsMental2021","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3054176","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"18235-18250","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Recognition of Students’ Mental States in Discussion Based on Multimodal Data and its Application to Educational Support","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

In contrast to traditional multi-sensor setups, our tool only requires a single 360° camera and uses state-of-the-art computer vision methods to automatically extract behavioral indicators, such as gaze direction, facial expressions, and speaking activity. As such, our tool allows for easy and fast deployment and supports researchers in understanding individual behavior, group interaction dynamics, and in quantifying user-object interactions.

  {"id":"pozdniakovQuestiondrivenDashboardHow2022","abstract":"One of the ultimate goals of several learning analytics (LA) initiatives is to close the loop and support students’ and teachers’ reflective practices. Although there has been a proliferation of end-user interfaces (often in the form of dashboards), various limitations have already been identified in the literature such as key stakeholders not being involved in their design, little or no account for sense-making needs, and unclear effects on teaching and learning. There has been a recent call for human-centred design practices to create LA interfaces in close collaboration with educational stakeholders to consider the learning design, and their authentic needs and pedagogical intentions. This paper addresses the call by proposing a question-driven LA design approach to ensure that end-user LA interfaces explicitly address teachers’ questions. We illustrate the approach in the context of synchronous online activities, orchestrated by pairs of teachers using audio-visual and text-based tools (namely Zoom and Google Docs). This study led to the design and deployment of an open-source monitoring tool to be used in real-time by teachers when students work collaboratively in breakout rooms, and across learning spaces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pozdniakov","given":"Stanislav"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Tsai","given":"Yi-Shan"},{"family":"Cukurova","given":"Mutlu"},{"family":"Bartindale","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Harrison"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Gasevic","given":"Dragan"}],"citation-key":"pozdniakovQuestiondrivenDashboardHow2022","collection-title":"LAK22","container-title":"LAK22: 12th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3506860.3506885","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9573-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,21]]},"page":"175–185","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The Question-driven Dashboard: How Can We Design Analytics Interfaces Aligned to Teachers Inquiry?","title-short":"The Question-driven Dashboard","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3506860.3506885"},

  {"id":"praharajAutomaticCollaborationAnalytics2021","abstract":"Collaboration is an important 21st Century skill. Co-located (or face-to-face) collaboration (CC) analytics gained momentum with the advent of sensor technology. Most of these works have used the audio modality to detect the quality of CC. The CC quality can be detected from simple indicators of collaboration such as total speaking time or complex indicators like synchrony in the rise and fall of the average pitch. Most studies in the past focused on “how group members talk” (i.e., spectral, temporal features of audio like pitch) and not “what they talk”. The “what” of the conversations is more overt contrary to the “how” of the conversations. Very few studies studied “what” group members talk about, and these studies were lab based showing a representative overview of specific words as topic clusters instead of analysing the richness of the content of the conversations by understanding the linkage between these words. To overcome this, we made a starting step in this technical paper based on field trials to prototype a tool to move towards automatic collaboration analytics. We designed a technical setup to collect, process and visualize audio data automatically. The data collection took place while a board game was played among the university staff with pre-assigned roles to create awareness of the connection between learning analytics and learning design. We not only did a word-level analysis of the conversations, but also analysed the richness of these conversations by visualizing the strength of the linkage between these words and phrases interactively. In this visualization, we used a network graph to visualize turn taking exchange between different roles along with the word-level and phrase-level analysis. We also used centrality measures to understand the network graph further based on how much words have hold over the network of words and how influential are certain words. Finally, we found that this approach had certain limitations in terms of automation in speaker diarization (i.e., who spoke when) and text data pre-processing. Therefore, we concluded that even though the technical setup was partially automated, it is a way forward to understand the richness of the conversations between different roles and makes a significant step towards automatic collaboration analytics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Praharaj","given":"Sambit"},{"family":"Scheffel","given":"Maren"},{"family":"Schmitz","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Specht","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Drachsler","given":"Hendrik"}],"citation-key":"praharajAutomaticCollaborationAnalytics2021","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s21093156","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"9","page":"3156","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Towards Automatic Collaboration Analytics for Group Speech Data Using Learning Analytics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/9/3156","volume":"21"},

Co-located collaboration (CC) is a very complex process that involves subtle human interactions that can be described with indicators like eye gaze, speaking time, pitch, and social skills from different modalities. With the advent of sensors, multimodal learning analytics has gained momentum to detect CC quality. Indicators (or low-level events) can be used to detect CC quality with the help of measurable markers (i.e., indexes composed of one or more indicators) which give the high-level collaboration process deﬁnition. However, this understanding is incomplete without considering the scenarios (such as problem solving or meetings) of CC. The scenario of CC affects the set of indicators considered: For instance, in collaborative programming, grabbing the mouse from the partner is an indicator of collaboration; whereas in collaborative meetings, eye gaze, and audio level are indicators of collaboration. This can be a result of the differing goals and fundamental parameters (such as group behavior, interaction, or composition) in each scenario. In this article, we present our work on proﬁles of indicators on the basis of a scenario-driven prioritization, the parameters in different CC scenarios are mapped onto the indicators and the available indexes. This deﬁnes the conceptual model to support the design of a CC quality detection and prediction system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Praharaj","given":"Sambit"},{"family":"Scheffel","given":"Maren"},{"family":"Drachsler","given":"Hendrik"},{"family":"Specht","given":"Marcus"}],"citation-key":"praharajLiteratureReviewCoLocated2021","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

To exploit these modalities in HCI, we need to understand the interplay between them and the way in which they support communication. We propose a framework for the gesture research done to date, and present our work on the cross-modal cues for discourse segmentation in free-form gesticulation accompanying speech in natural conversation as a new paradigm for such multimodal interaction. The basis for this integration is the psycholinguistic concept of the coequal generation of gesture and speech from the same semantic intent. We present a detailed case study of a gesture and speech elicitation experiment in which a subject describes her living space to an interlocutor. We perform two independent sets of analyses on the video and audio data: video and audio analysis to extract segmentation cues, and expert transcription of the speech and gesture data by microanalyzing the videotape using a frame-accurate videoplayer to correlate the speech with the gestural entities. We compare the results of both analyses to identify the cues accessible in the gestural and audio data that correlate well with the expert psycholinguistic analysis. We show that \"handedness\" and the kind of symmetry in two-handed gestures provide effective supersegmental discourse cues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Quek","given":"Francis"},{"family":"McNeill","given":"David"},{"family":"Bryll","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Duncan","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Xin-Feng"},{"family":"Kirbas","given":"Cemil"},{"family":"McCullough","given":"Karl E."},{"family":"Ansari","given":"Rashid"}],"citation-key":"quekMultimodalHumanDiscourse2002","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

  {"id":"qvarfordtGazeinformedMultimodalInteraction2017","abstract":"Observe a person pointing out and describing something. Where is that person looking? Chances are good that this person also looks at what she is talking about and pointing at. Gaze is naturally coordinated with our speech and hand movements. By utilizing this tendency, we can create a natural interaction with computing devices and environments. In multimodal gaze interaction, data from eye trackers are used as an active input mode, where, for instance, gaze is used as an alternative, or complementary, pointing modality along with other input modalities. Using gaze as an active, or explicit, input method is challenging for several reasons. One of them being that eyes are primarily used for perceiving our environment, so knowing when a person selects an item with gaze versus just looking around is an issue. Researchers have tried to solve this by combining gaze with various input methods, such as manual pointing, speech, touch, etc. However, gaze information can also be used in interactive systems for other purposes than explicit pointing, since a user's gaze is a good indication of the user's attention. In passive gaze interaction, the gaze is not used as the primary input method, but as a supporting one. In these kinds of systems, gaze is mainly used for inferring and reasoning about the user's cognitive state or activities in a way that can support the interaction. These kinds of multimodal systems often combine gaze with a multitude of input modalities. One example is to detect what features in an image a person is looking for, and use this information to suggest regions or other images that the person has not yet seen. In this chapter, eye movement and eye tracking data analysis is first reviewed (Section 9.2), followed by a discussion of eye movements in relation to other modalities (Section 9.3) to gain basic knowledge about eye tracking and gaze behavior. In Section 9.4, systems using gaze as active or passive input methods are discussed.

Using methodological developments in research on self-regulated learning as an example, it argues that current applications of data-driven analytical techniques, such as educational data mining and its branch process mining, are deeply grounded in an event-focused, ontologically flat view of learning phenomena. These techniques provide descriptive accounts of the regularities of events, but have limited power to generate theoretical explanations. Building on the philosophical views of critical realism, the paper argues that educational e-research needs to adopt more nuanced ways for investigating and theorising learning phenomena that could provide an account of the mechanisms and contexts in which those mechanisms are realised. It proposes that future methodological extensions should include three main aspects: (1) stratified ontological frameworks, (2) multimodal data collection and (3) dynamic analytical methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Reimann","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Markauskaite","given":"Lina"},{"family":"Bannert","given":"Maria"}],"citation-key":"reimannEResearchLearningTheory2014","container-title":"British Journal of Educational Technology","container-title-short":"British Journal of Educational Technology","DOI":"10.1111/bjet.12146","ISSN":"0007-1013","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,1]]},"page":"528-540","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"bera-journals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.uio.no (Atypon)","title":"e-Research and learning theory: What do sequence and process mining methods contribute?","title-short":"e-Research and learning theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://bera.journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12146","volume":"45"},

Most studies (55; 47%) involved undergraduate medical students and took place in the US (72; 61%). The most commonly studied framework component was Teacher and Learner Attitudes (97; 82%). Other commonly studied elements included Learning Outcomes (85; 72%) and Team Characteristics (25; 21%). Contextual Factors affecting TBL was addressed in one study.Conclusions: A substantial body of literature examines the effect that TBL has on traditional measures of achievement. However, many dimensions of TBL have not been well studied, including Teacher Decisions about TBL, Contextual Factors that affect TBL, Learners’ Engagement, and Pattern of Engagement within Teams. Future research in these areas could determine the best use of TBL in HPE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Reimschisel","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Herring","given":"Anna L."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Minor","given":"Tara J."}],"citation-key":"reimschiselSystematicReviewPublished2017","container-title":"Medical Teacher","DOI":"10.1080/0142159X.2017.1340636","ISSN":"0142-159X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,2]]},"page":"1227-1237","PMID":"28664760","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A systematic review of the published literature on team-based learning in health professions education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159X.2017.1340636","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"riquelmeWhereAreYou2020","abstract":"Classroom teaching methodologies are gradually changing from masterclasses to active learning practices, and peer collaboration emerges as an essential skill to be developed. However, there are several challenges in evaluating collaborative activities more objectively, as well as to generate valuable information to teachers and appropriate feedback to students about their learning processes. In this context, multimodal learning analytics facilitate the evaluation of complex skills using data from multiple data sources. In this work, we propose the use of beacons to collect geolocation data from students who carry out collaborative tasks that involve movement and interactions through space. Furthermore, we suggest new ways to analyze, visualize, and interpret the data obtained. As a first practical approach, we carried out an exploratory, collaborative activity with sixteen undergraduate students working in a library, with bookshelves and work tables monitored by beacons. From the analysis of student movement dynamics, three types of well-differentiated student roles were identified: the collectors, those who go out to collect data from the bookshelves, ambassadors, those who communicate with other groups, and the secretaries, those who stay at their work desk to shape the requested essay. We believe these findings are valuable feedback for the enhancement of the learning activity and the first step towards MMLA-driven Teaching Process Improvement method.","author":[{"family":"Riquelme","given":"Fabián"},{"family":"Noel","given":"Rene"},{"family":"Cornide-Reyes","given":"Hector"},{"family":"Geldes","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Cechinel","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Miranda","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Villarroel","given":"Rodolfo"},{"family":"Munoz","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"riquelmeWhereAreYou2020","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10/gpb4m5","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"125776-125785","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Where are You?

However, these scenarios are highly heterogeneous, and the varying data sources available in each particular context can condition the accuracy, relevance, interpretability and actionability of the Learning Analytics (LA) solutions, affecting also the user's sense of agency and trust in such solutions. To aid stakeholders in making use of learning analytics, we propose a process to involve teachers in customizing multimodal LA (MMLA) solutions, adapting them to their particular blended learning situation (e.g., identifying relevant data sources and metrics). Since measuring the added value of adopting an LA solution is not straightforward, we also propose a concrete method for doing so. The results obtained from two case studies in authentic, blended computer-supported collaborative learning settings show an improvement in the sensitivity and F1 scores of the customized MMLA solution. Aside from these quantitative improvements, participant teachers reported both an increment in the effort involved, but also increased relevance, understanding and actionability of the results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodríguez-Triana","given":"María Jesüs"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Luis P."},{"family":"Martínez-Monés","given":"Alejandra"},{"family":"Asensio-Pérez","given":"Juan I."},{"family":"Dimitriadis","given":"Yannis"}],"citation-key":"rodriguez-trianaTeacherLoopCustomizing2018","collection-title":"LAK '18","container-title":"Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge","DOI":"10.1145/3170358.3170364","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6400-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"417–426","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The teacher in the loop: customizing multimodal learning analytics for blended learning","title-short":"The teacher in the loop","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3170358.3170364"},

This work draws on a situative perspective, along with prior framings of individual engagement, to conceptualize engagement as a shared and multidimensional phenomenon. A multidimensional conceptualization affords the study of distinct engagement dimensions, as well as the interrelationships of engagement dimensions that together are productive. Development and exploration of an observational rubric evaluating collaborative group disciplinary engagement (GDE) is presented, leveraging the benefits of observational methods with a rubric specifying quality ratings, enabling the potential for analyses of larger samples more efficiently than prior approaches, but with similar ability to richly characterize the shared and multidimensional nature of group engagement. Mixed-methods analyses, including case illustrations and profile analysis, showcase the synergistic interrelations among engagement dimensions constituting GDE. The rubric effectively captured engagement features that could be identified via intensive video analysis, while affording the evaluation of broader claims about group engagement patterns. Application of the rubric across curricular contexts, and within and between lessons across a curricular unit, will enable comparative studies that can inform theory about collaborative engagement, as well as instructional design and practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Rogat","given":"Toni Kempler"},{"family":"Hmelo-Silver","given":"Cindy E."},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Britte Haugan"},{"family":"Traynor","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Adeoye","given":"Temitope F."},{"family":"Gomoll","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Downing","given":"Brenda K."}],"citation-key":"rogatMultidimensionalFrameworkCollaborative2022","container-title":"Frontline Learning Research","DOI":"10.14786/flr.v10i2.863","ISSN":"2295-3159","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,9]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 Frontline Learning Research","number":"2","page":"1-21","source":"journals.sfu.ca","title":"A Multidimensional Framework of Collaborative Groups’ Disciplinary Engagement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sfu.ca/flr/flr/index.php/journal/article/view/863","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"roschelleLearningCollaboratingConvergent1992","abstract":"The goal of this article is to construct an integrated approach to collaboration and conceptual change. To this end, a case of conceptual change is analyzed from the point of view of conversational interaction. It is proposed that the crux of collaboration is the problem of convergence: How can two (or more) people construct shared meanings for conversations, concepts, and experiences? Collaboration is analyzed as a process that gradually can lead to convergence of meaning. The epistemological basis of the framework of analysis is a relational, situated view of meaning: Meanings are taken to be relations among situations and verbal or gestural actions. The central claim is that a process described by four primary features can account for students' incremental achievement of convergent conceptual change. The process is characterized by (a) the production of a deep-featured situation, in relation to (b) the interplay of physical metaphors, through the constructive use of (c) interactive cycles of conversational turn-taking, constrained by (d) the application of progressively higher standards of evidence for convergence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Roschelle","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"roschelleLearningCollaboratingConvergent1992","container-title":"Journal of the Learning Sciences","DOI":"10.1207/s15327809jls0203_1","ISSN":"1050-8406","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",7,1]]},"page":"235-276","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Learning by Collaborating: Convergent Conceptual Change","title-short":"Learning by Collaborating","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327809jls0203_1","volume":"2"},

Studies describe how formal and informal digital media practices differ. The interconnections between these two life-worlds experienced by young people present a challenge to researchers. To investigate such networks, the authors have used a learning ecology methodology to make explicit contexts found in physical and virtual spaces that provide opportunities for learning. Each context comprises ‘funds of knowledge’ or social and cultural resources. The authors asked: how can digital media support and enhance the interconnection between learning practices in and out of school? This study of three 15-year-old students in a multiethnic suburb in Oslo, Norway, illustrates how personal interest in digital media spurred by ‘funds of knowledge’ in informal contexts has aided the development of formal learning. Such practices enable students to use research-based methods and structured problem solving and to draw on interests and expertise from different contexts. The use of digital media has catalysed improved learning identity.

  {"id":"rummelAnalyzingCollaborativeInteractions2011","abstract":"In this chapter we report on the development of a rating scheme for the analysis of collaborative process data, and on its implementation in diverse CSCL settings. The rating scheme is composed of nine dimensions measuring ­different aspects of collaboration quality: sustaining mutual understanding, dialogue ­management, information pooling, reaching consensus, task division, time management, technical coordination, reciprocal interaction, and individual task orientation. It can be applied to recordings (video, audio, screen recordings, or log data) of student interaction and does not necessarily require transcripts or written records. While the rating scheme was originally developed in the context of a specific CSCL setting (video-based interdisciplinary problem-solving in the medical domain; Meier et al. (2007)), we demonstrate in our chapter that it can successfully be adapted to other CSCL settings. First, we introduce the initial rating scheme and its dimensions. Next we describe the process of adapting it to data from a very different CSCL setting (chat-based interaction in computer science classes). We briefly report on a study that used the ratings of collaboration quality as basis for adaptive feedback to students on how to improve their collaboration. Finally, we describe how we have integrated our rating scheme with ActivityLens (Avouris et al. 2007), a software tool which allows for a combined analysis of multiple sources of data (e.g., logfiles, audio and video recordings).

In an experimental study with N = 178 pre-service teachers about simulated pupils with learning difficulties, we investigated the effects of automatic adaptive feedback, which is based on artificial neural networks, on pre-service teachers' diagnostic reasoning. Diagnostic reasoning was operationalised as diagnostic accuracy and the quality of justifications. We compared automatic adaptive feedback with static feedback, which we provided in form of an expert solution. Further, we experimentally manipulated whether the learners worked individually or in dyads on the computer lab-based simulations. Results show that adaptive feedback facilitates pre-service teachers’ quality of justifications in written assignments, but not their diagnostic accuracy. Further, static feedback even had detrimental effects on the learning process in dyads. Automatic adaptive feedback in simulations offers scalable, elaborate, process-oriented feedback in real-time to high numbers of students in higher education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sailer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Hofmann","given":"Riikka"},{"family":"Kiesewetter","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Glas","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Gurevych","given":"Iryna"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"sailerAdaptiveFeedbackArtificial2023","container-title":"Learning and Instruction","container-title-short":"Learning and Instruction","DOI":"10.1016/j.learninstruc.2022.101620","ISSN":"0959-4752","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"page":"101620","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Adaptive feedback from artificial neural networks facilitates pre-service teachers’ diagnostic reasoning in simulation-based learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095947522200041X","volume":"83"},

Drawing upon the existing extensive body of research surrounding the topic of teamwork, we delineate nine “critical considerations” that serve as a practical heuristic by which HR leaders can determine what is needed when they face situations involving teamwork. Our heuristic is not intended to be the definitive set of all considerations for teamwork, but instead consolidates key findings from a vast literature to provide an integrated understanding of the underpinnings of teamwork—specifically, what should be considered when selecting, developing, and maintaining teams. This heuristic is designed to help those in practice diagnose team-based problems by providing a clear focus on relevant aspects of teamwork. To this end, we first define teamwork and its related elements. Second, we offer a high-level conceptualization of and justification for the nine selected considerations underlying the heuristic, which is followed by a more in-depth synthesis of related literature as well as empirically-driven practical guidance. Third, we conclude with a discussion regarding how this heuristic may best be used from a practical standpoint, as well as offer areas for future research regarding both teamwork and its critical considerations. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Salas","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Shuffler","given":"Marissa L."},{"family":"Thayer","given":"Amanda L."},{"family":"Bedwell","given":"Wendy L."},{"family":"Lazzara","given":"Elizabeth H."}],"citation-key":"salasUnderstandingImprovingTeamwork2015","container-title":"Human Resource Management","DOI":"10/gfgzcv","ISSN":"1099-050X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"599-622","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Understanding and Improving Teamwork in Organizations: A Scientifically Based Practical Guide","title-short":"Understanding and Improving Teamwork in Organizations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hrm.21628","volume":"54"},

In turn, educational providers have adopted active learning methodologies, such as collaborative problem-solving. However, the objective evaluation of collaboration at scale still is a challenge. This paper explores the relationship between quantitative measures obtained from automated transcriptions of speech and qualitative indicators of effective collaboration. An omnidirectional microphone and an artificial intelligence algorithm were used to collect speaking data from 20 triads of students discussing and building a concept map. The study focused on validating the potential value of speech recording devices to quantify the dynamics of communication networks by comparing quantitative metrics obtained from them with an established rating scheme for measuring the extent of collaboration. Results showed a relationship between the standard deviations of the speaking times of the participants in each group and the evaluation obtained from the qualitative rubrics of communication and interpersonal relationships. Thus, the extent to which all group members contribute to the discourse can potentially serve as an indicator of effective group work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Salinas","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Riquelme","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Munoz","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Cechinel","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Monsalves","given":"Diego"}],"citation-key":"salinasCanAnalyticsSpeaking2021","container-title":"X Latin American Conference on Human Computer Interaction","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8489-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,22]]},"page":"1–4","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Can Analytics of Speaking Time Serve as Indicators of Effective Team Communication and Collaboration?","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3488392.3488404"},

There is a need to develop comprehensive understanding and integration of theory (concept) and practice (process) of PSS in the context of experiential learning (EL). Design/methodology/approach The present study is qualitative in nature using a conceptual research design focussing on synthesis and model building framework. The key elements of the study are PSS, EL and their integration. The study seeks to develop conceptual integration of PSS across multiple theories and perspectives. It offers an enhanced view of a concept of PSS by summarising and integrating extant knowledge. It presents the complete and comprehensive meaning/definition of PSS. Subsequently, it also explores EL and synthesises the different variants of EL that can be used to develop PSS. Finally, the study builds a theoretical framework that proposes integration and interplay between PSS and EL. Findings Problem-solving operates at three levels: problem concept (nature and context), process (stages with strategies) and solution (open-ended). EL can be used as a tool to develop PSS in an integrated manner. It is found that EL and problem-solving interplay with each other as both are cyclic in nature and have commonalities strengthening each other. Practical implications The proposed framework can be adopted in engineering education for making the engineering graduates job ready. Originality/value The study proposes a framework based on integration of EL and problem-solving focusing on specific aims and goals of the course, learning approaches, learning strategies and authentic learning (learning environment). This integration would bridge the gap between engineering education and industry requirements.

Important aspects of communication behavior are covered: the directly observable aspects of who speaks to whom, the functions of a statement for the interaction process, and the interpersonal meaning of an act on the two basic behavioral dimensions of affiliation and dominance. Furthermore, coding software was developed that greatly enhances the efficiency of coding as well as the creation of data files. The reliabilities are strong if video is used. The reliabilities for real-time coding are considerably lower but still satisfactory if special measures are taken.

For example, a student may frame a learning activity as an opportunity for sensemaking or as an assignment to fill out a worksheet.

We apply this observational methodology to explore dynamics among behavior, framing, and the conceptual substance of student reasoning in the context of collaborative active-learning activities in an introductory university physics course.

  {"id":"schneiderAugmentingSocialScience2022","abstract":"While the majority of social scientists still rely on traditional research instruments (e.g., surveys, self-reports, qualitative observations), multimodal sensing is becoming an emerging methodology for capturing human behaviors. Sensing technology has the potential to complement and enrich traditional measures by providing high frequency data on people’s behavior, cognition and affects. However, there is currently no easy-to-use toolkit for recording multimodal data streams. Existing methodologies rely on the use of physical sensors and custom-written code for accessing sensor data. In this paper, we present the EZ-MMLA toolkit. This toolkit was implemented as a website and provides easy access to multimodal data collection algorithms. One can collect a variety of data modalities: data on users’ attention (eye-tracking), physiological states (heart rate), body posture (skeletal data), gestures (from hand motion), emotions (from facial expressions and speech) and lower-level computer vision algorithms (e.g., fiducial/color tracking). This toolkit can run from any browser and does not require dedicated hardware or programming experience. We compare this toolkit with traditional methods and describe a case study where the EZ-MMLA toolkit was used by aspiring educational researchers in a classroom context. We conclude by discussing future work and other applications of this toolkit, potential limitations and implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Hassan","given":"Javaria"},{"family":"Sung","given":"Gahyun"}],"citation-key":"schneiderAugmentingSocialScience2022","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s22020568","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"568","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Augmenting Social Science Research with Multimodal Data Collection: The EZ-MMLA Toolkit","title-short":"Augmenting Social Science Research with Multimodal Data Collection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/2/568","volume":"22"},

Second, network metrics can be computed to interpret the properties of the graph and find proxies for the quality of students’ collaboration. We found that different characteristics of our graphs correlated with different aspects of students’ collaboration (for instance, the extent to which students reached consensus was associated with the average size of the strongly connected components of the graphs). Third, we used those characteristics to predict the quality of students’ collaboration by feeding those features into a machine-learning algorithm. We found that among the eight dimensions of collaboration that we considered, we were able to roughly predict (using a median-split) students’ quality of collaboration with an accuracy between ~85 and 100 %.

The goals of this paper are (1) to explore a variety of computational techniques for analyzing the transcripts of student discussions; (2) to examine whether any of those measures sheds new light on our previous results; and (3) to test whether those metrics have any predictive power regarding learning outcomes. Using various natural language processing algorithms, we found that linguistic coordination (i.e., the extent to which students mimic each other in terms of their grammatical structure) did not predict the quality of student collaboration or learning gains. However, we found that a simple computational measure of student verbal coherence (i.e., the extent to which students build on each other's ideas) was positively correlated with their learning gains. Additionally, this measure was significantly different across our experimental conditions: students who could see the gaze of their partner in real time were more likely to develop a coherent discussion. Finally, using various language metrics, we were able to roughly predict (i.e., using a median-split) learning gains with a 94.4% accuracy using Support Vector Machine. The accuracy dropped to 75% when we used our model on a validation set.

We collected a multimodal dataset during a collaborative learning activity typical of makerspaces: learning how to program a robot. Pairs of participants were introduced to computational thinking concepts using a block-based environment. Mobile eye-trackers, physiological wristbands, and motion sensors captured their behavior and social interactions. In this paper, we analyze the eye-tracking data to capture participants’ tendency to synchronize their visual attention. This paper provides three contributions: (1) we use an emerging methodology (mobile dual eye-tracking) to capture joint visual attention in a co-located setting and replicate findings that show how levels of joint visual attention are positively correlated with collaboration quality; (2) we qualitatively analyzed the co-occurrence of verbal activity and joint visual attention in low and high performing groups to better understand moments of collaboration and cooperation; (3) inspired by the qualitative observations and theories of collaborative learning, we designed a new quantitative measure that captures cycles of collaborative and cooperative work. Compared to simple measures of joint visual attention, we found it to increase correlation coefficients with learning and collaboration scores.

Based on the lessons learnt from the review, we also identify that design tensions like architecture distribution, flexibility and extensibility (and an increased focus on data organization and decision making) are some of the most promising issues to be addressed by the MMLA community in the near future.","author":[{"family":"Shankar","given":"Shashi Kant"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Luis P."},{"family":"Rodríguez-Triana","given":"María Jesús"},{"family":"Ruiz-Calleja","given":"Adolfo"}],"citation-key":"shankarReviewMultimodalLearning2018","container-title":"2018 IEEE 18th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)","DOI":"10.1109/ICALT.2018.00057","event-title":"2018 IEEE 18th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)","ISSN":"2161-377X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"page":"212-214","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Review of Multimodal Learning Analytics Architectures","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"shockleyArticulatoryConstraintsInterpersonal2007","abstract":"Cooperative conversation has been shown to foster interpersonal postural coordination. The authors investigated whether such coordination is mediated by the influence of articulation on postural sway. In Experiment 1, talkers produced words in synchrony or in alternation, as the authors varied speaking rate and word similarity. Greater shared postural activity was found for the faster speaking rate. In Experiment 2, the authors demonstrated that shared postural activity also increases when individuals speak the same words or speak words that have similar stress patterns. However, this increase in shared postural activity is present only when participants' data are compared with those of their partner, who was present during the task, but not when compared with the data of a member of a different pair speaking the same word sequences as those of the original partner. The authors' findings suggest that interpersonal postural coordination observed during conversation is mediated by convergent speaking patterns.

This work explores collaborative learner dialogue through theories of alignment, analysing inter-partner movement and language use with respect to our hypotheses: that they interrelate, and that they form predictors of collaboration quality and learning. In keeping with theories of alignment, we find that linguistic alignment and gestural synchrony both correlate significantly with one another in dialogue. We also find strong individual correlations of these metrics with collaboration quality. We find that linguistic and gestural alignment also correlate with learning. Through regression analysis, we find that although interconnected, these measures in combination are significant predictors of collaborative problem solving success. We contribute additional evidence to support the theory that alignment takes place across multiple levels of communication, and provide a methodological approach for analysing inter-speaker dynamics in a multimodal task based setting. Our work has implications for the teaching community, our measures can help identify poorly performing groups, lending itself to informing the design of real time intervention strategies or formative assessment for collaborative learning.

  {"id":"sottilareDesigningAdaptiveInstruction2018","abstract":"The goal of this research was the development of a practical architecture for the computer-based tutoring of teams. This article examines the relationship of team behaviors as antecedents to successful team performance and learning during adaptive instruction guided by Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Adaptive instruction is a training or educational experience tailored by artificially-intelligent, computer-based tutors with the goal of optimizing learner outcomes (e.g., knowledge and skill acquisition, performance, enhanced retention, accelerated learning, or transfer of skills from instructional environments to work environments). The core contribution of this research was the identification of behavioral markers associated with the antecedents of team performance and learning thus enabling the development and refinement of teamwork models in ITS architectures. Teamwork focuses on the coordination, cooperation, and communication among individuals to achieve a shared goal. For ITSs to optimally tailor team instruction, tutors must have key insights about both the team and the learners on that team. To aid the modeling of teams, we examined the literature to evaluate the relationship of teamwork behaviors (e.g., communication, cooperation, coordination, cognition, leadership/coaching, and conflict) with team outcomes (learning, performance, satisfaction, and viability) as part of a large-scale meta-analysis of the ITS, team training, and team performance literature. While ITSs have been used infrequently to instruct teams, the goal of this meta-analysis make team tutoring more ubiquitous by: identifying significant relationships between team behaviors and effective performance and learning outcomes; developing instructional guidelines for team tutoring based on these relationships; and applying these team tutoring guidelines to the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open source architecture for authoring, delivering, managing, and evaluating adaptive instructional tools and methods. In doing this, we have designed a domain-independent framework for the adaptive instruction of teams.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sottilare","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Shawn Burke","given":"C."},{"family":"Salas","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Sinatra","given":"Anne M."},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Joan H."},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Stephen B."}],"citation-key":"sottilareDesigningAdaptiveInstruction2018","container-title":"International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education","container-title-short":"Int J Artif Intell Educ","DOI":"10/gdsmf3","ISSN":"1560-4306","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"225-264","source":"Springer Link","title":"Designing Adaptive Instruction for Teams: a Meta-Analysis","title-short":"Designing Adaptive Instruction for Teams","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-017-0146-z","volume":"28"},

Based on the AICHE model, some recent technologies and educational applications of these are analysed and set in relation to the core components and processes of the model. In that analysis the key processes of the AICHE such as aggregation, enrichment and especially synchronisation are also identified as key features enabling seamless learning to be effective, efficient and enjoyable.

To answer this question, we have explored different supervised machine learning approaches (traditional and deep learning techniques) to analyse the data coming from multiple sources. The results illustrate that state-of-the-art computational techniques can be used to generate insights into the 'black box' of learning in students' project-based activities.

Automatic modeling of CPS processes (called facets here) is a precursor to this goal. Accordingly, we build automated detectors of three critical CPS facets—construction of shared knowledge, negotiation and coordination, and maintaining team function—derived from a validated CPS framework. We used data of 32 triads who collaborated via a commercial videoconferencing software, to solve challenging problems in a visual programming task. We generated transcripts of 11,163 utterances using automatic speech recognition, which were then coded by trained humans for evidence of the three CPS facets. We used both standard and deep sequential learning classifiers to model the human-coded facets from linguistic, task context, facial expressions, and acoustic–prosodic features in a team-independent fashion. We found that models relying on nonverbal signals yielded above-chance accuracies (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUROC) ranging from .53 to .83, with increases in model accuracy when language information was included (AUROCS from .72 to .86). There were no advantages of deep sequential learning methods over standard classifiers. Overall, Random Forest classifiers using language and task context features performed best, achieving AUROC scores of .86, .78, and .79 for construction of shared knowledge, negotiation/coordination, and maintaining team function, respectively. We discuss application of our work to real-time systems that assess CPS and intervene to improve CPS outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Angela E.

We trained feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) and long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs) using group-level nested cross-validation. LSTMs outperformed FFNNs and a chance baseline and could predict speech rate up to 6s into the future. A multimodal combination of speech rate, acoustic-prosodic, and task context features outperformed unimodal and bimodal signals. The extent to which the models could predict an individual's speech rate was positively related to that individual's scores on a subsequent posttest, suggesting a link between coordination/coregulation and collaborative learning outcomes.

  {"id":"strengMetaphorDiagramComparing2009","abstract":"This paper aims at answering the question how ambient displays can be used as group mirrors to support collaborative (learning) activities. Our research question is to what extent the type of feedback representation affects collaborative processes. Two different representations have been created and compared in a user study: a diagram and a metaphor. In the diagram version the quality rating for each person is explicitly shown in charts and numbers. In the metaphorical representation feedback is implicitly visualized by changing certain characteristics of a pictorial scene. The results show that the metaphoric group mirror was not only more popular than the diagram, it also had a greater impact on the group behavior. When receiving negative feedback from the metaphoric group mirror, a correction of behavior was made significantly faster than with the diagram.

One line of research has been to introduce synchronous, or simultaneous, communication attempting to create text‐based digital real‐time interaction. Compared with face‐to‐face (F2F) communication, CMC may be a poorer medium regarding coordination of the activity. Still, we are in need for more knowledge on the possible advantages and problems regarding such digital communication processes. In the present study, we compared activities in digital and F2F problem‐based learning (PBL) regarding the content of the communication, turn‐taking processes and the emergence of learning issues. The results indicate that when students discussed in the digital learning environment, they focused more on technical and organizational questions, produced relatively more initiatives but less responses, and produced less elaborated and specified learning issues than when they participated in F2F meetings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Strømsø","given":"H.I."},{"family":"Grøttum","given":"P."},{"family":"Lycke","given":"K.H."}],"citation-key":"stromsoContentProcessesProblem2007","container-title":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","container-title-short":"Computer Assisted Learning","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2729.2007.00221.x","ISSN":"0266-4909, 1365-2729","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",6]]},"language":"en","page":"271-282","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Content and processes in problem‐based learning: a comparison of computer‐mediated and face‐to‐face communication","title-short":"Content and processes in problem‐based learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2729.2007.00221.x","volume":"23"},

It was found that the presence of the feedback about speaking time influenced the behaviour of the participants in such a way that it made over-participators to behave less dominant and under-participators to become more active.

  {"id":"sullivanUsingEpistemicNetwork2018","abstract":"Background\nEpistemic Network Analysis (ENA) is a technique for modeling and comparing the structure of connections between elements in coded data. We hypothesized that connections among team discourse elements as modeled by ENA would predict the quality of team performance in trauma simulation.\nMethods\nThe Modified Non-technical Skills Scale for Trauma (T-NOTECHS) was used to score a simulation-based trauma team resuscitation. Sixteen teams of 5 trainees participated. Dialogue was coded using Verbal Response Modes (VRM), a speech classification system. ENA was used to model the connections between VRM codes. ENA models of teams with lesser T-NOTECHS scores (n = 9, mean = 16.98, standard deviation [SD] = 1.45) were compared with models of teams with greater T-NOTECHS scores (n = 7, mean = 21.02, SD = 1.09).\nResults\nTeams had different patterns of connections among VRM speech form codes with regard to connections among questions and edifications (meanHIGH = 0.115, meanLOW = −0.089; t = 2.21; P = .046, Cohen d = 1.021). Greater-scoring groups had stronger connections between stating information and providing acknowledgments, confirmation, or advising. Lesser-scoring groups had a stronger connection between asking questions and stating information. Discourse data suggest that this pattern reflected increased uncertainty. Lesser-scoring groups also had stronger connections from edifications to disclosures (revealing thoughts, feelings, and intentions) and interpretations (explaining, judging, and evaluating the behavior of others).\nConclusion\nENA is a novel and valid method to assess communication among trauma teams. Differences in communication among higher- and lower-performing teams appear to result from the ways teams use questions. ENA allowed us to identify targets for improvement related to the use of questions and stating information by team members.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Warner-Hillard","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Eagan","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Ryan J."},{"family":"Ruis","given":"A.

  {"id":"sunGeneralizedCompetencyModel2020","abstract":"Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is an essential skill in the 21st century. There is a need for an appropriate framework and operationalization of CPS to guide its assessment and support and across multiple domains. Accordingly, we synthesized prior research on CPS to construct a generalized CPS competency model (i.e., skills and abilities) consisting of the following core facets: constructing shared knowledge, negotiation/coordination, and maintaining team function. Each facet has two sub-facets, which in turn, have multiple verbal and nonverbal indicators. We validated our model in two empirical studies involving triadic CPS, but in very different contexts – middle-school students playing an educational game in a 3-h, face-to-face session vs. college students engaging in a visual programming task for 20 min via videoconferencing. We used principal component analysis to investigate whether the empirical data aligned with our theorized model. Correlational analyses provided evidence on the orthogonality of the facets and their independence to individual differences in prior knowledge, intelligence and personality and regression analyses indicated that the facets predicted both subjective and objective outcome measures controlling for several covariates. Thus we provide initial evidence for the convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of our model by using two different CPS contexts and student populations. This shows promise towards generalizing across various human-human CPS interactive environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Shute","given":"Valerie J."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Yonehiro","given":"Jade"},{"family":"Duran","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"D'Mello","given":"Sidney"}],"citation-key":"sunGeneralizedCompetencyModel2020","container-title":"Computers & Education","container-title-short":"Computers & Education","DOI":"10/ghptnp","ISSN":"0360-1315","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103672","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Towards a generalized competency model of collaborative problem solving","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131519302258","volume":"143"},

  {"id":"sungYourBodyTells2024","abstract":"Collaborative learning, driven by knowledge co-construction and meaning negotiation, is a pivotal aspect of educational contexts. While gesture's importance in conveying shared meaning is recognized, its role in collaborative group settings remains understudied. This gap hinders accurate and equitable assessment and instruction, particularly for linguistically diverse students. Advancements in multimodal learning analytics, leveraging sensor technologies, offer innovative solutions for capturing and analysing body movements. This study employs these novel approaches to demonstrate how learners' machine-detected body movements during the learning process relate to their verbal and nonverbal contributions to the co-construction of embodied math knowledge. These findings substantiate the feasibility of utilizing learners' machine-detected body movements as a valid indicator for inferring their engagement with the collaborative knowledge construction process. In addition, we empirically validate that these inferred different levels of learner engagement indeed impact the desired learning outcomes of the intervention. This study contributes to our scientific understanding of multimodal approaches to knowledge expression and assessment in learning, teaching, and collaboration.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Previous research emphasizes the importance of gestures as essential tools for constructing common ground and reflecting shared meaning-making in learning and teaching contexts. The prior studies in multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) suggest that certain forms of body movements and postures can be differentiated based on the automatic detection of upper body joint locations. Empirical observations indicate that co-thought gestures typically involve smaller hand or arms movement that are closer to the gesturer's body than co-speech gestures used in interpersonal communication. What this paper adds This paper fills the research gap by examining the use of gestures in collaborative learning, offering insights into how individuals contribute verbally and nonverbally to collaborative knowledge construction. This paper introduces the concept of using machine-detected body movements as a viable proxy for inferring learners' engagement in collaborative knowledge-building activities. Leverages sensor technologies for automatic detection of body movements, the innovative approach in this work seeks to overcome the time-intensive and laborious process of manually coding gestures. Implications for practice and/or policy By recognizing the potential significance of learners' body movements in indicating engagement levels with collaborative knowledge-building activities, instructors can set up computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments to enable capturing these movements. Given the crucial role of gestures in learning, teaching, and collaboration, educators can create more equitable formative assessment practices for linguistically diverse students by developing strategies that align with multimodal forms of knowledge expression. Research can expand beyond mathematics to explore the transferability of these findings to other subjects, helping educators create comprehensive pedagogical approaches that leverage multimodal interactions across disciplines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Sung","given":"Hanall"},{"family":"Nathan","given":"Mitchell J."}],"citation-key":"sungYourBodyTells2024","container-title":"British Journal of Educational Technology","DOI":"10.1111/bjet.13473","ISSN":"1467-8535","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","page":"1950-1973","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Your body tells how you engage in collaboration: Machine-detected body movements as indicators of engagement in collaborative math knowledge building","title-short":"Your body tells how you engage in collaboration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjet.13473","volume":"55"},

However, current methods for measuring the CPS processes of individuals, such as coding and counting, treat these processes as sets of isolated and independent events.

This article examines the communications of air defense warfare teams from an experiment comparing two different computer-based decision support systems, using this data to ask whether ENA provides a more ecologically valid quantitative model of CPS than coding and counting. Qualitative analysis showed that commanders using one system asked questions to understand the tactical situation, while commanders using an experimental system focused more on actions in response to the tactical situation. Neither of the coding and counting approaches we tested corroborated these findings with statistically significant results. In contrast, ENA created models of the individual contributions of commanders that (a) showed statistical differences between commanders using the two systems to corroborate the qualitative analysis, and (b) revealed differences in individual performance. This suggests that ENA is a more powerful tool for CPS assessment than coding and counting approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Swiecki","given":"Zachari"},{"family":"Ruis","given":"A.

  {"id":"swieckiMeasuringImpactInterdependence2021","abstract":"Collaboration analytics often focuses on assessing and monitoring individuals during collaborative problem-solving (CPS). A defining feature of CPS is the interdependence that exists between individuals when they work together — that is, how they respond to and influence one another over time. While models that account for the impact of interdependence at the individual level of analysis (interdependent models) exist, they are often highly complex.\nThis complexity makes them potentially difficult to use in assessments and systems that need to be explainable for educators, learners, and other researchers. Measures of the impact of interdependence at the individual level of analysis could inform decisions as to whether interdependent models should be used, or whether simpler models will suffice. Such measures could also be used to investigate specific questions about interdependence in collaborative settings. In this paper, I present a novel method of measuring the impact of interdependence on individuals using epistemic network analysis. To provide evidence of the validity of the measure, I compare it to qualitative findings that describe the impact of interdependence on individuals participating in team training scenarios. To demonstrate the value of the measure, I use it to assess the impact of interdependence in these data overall and to test hypotheses regarding the collaborative task design. My results suggest that the measure can distinguish between individuals who have been impacted by interdependence differently, that interdependence is impactful in these data overall, and that aspects of the task design may have affected how some individuals were impacted by interdependence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Swiecki","given":"Zachari"}],"citation-key":"swieckiMeasuringImpactInterdependence2021","container-title":"Journal of Learning Analytics","DOI":"10/gm7tz9","ISSN":"1929-7750","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,8]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2021 Journal of Learning Analytics","number":"1","page":"75-94","source":"www.learning-analytics.info","title":"Measuring the Impact of Interdependence on Individuals During Collaborative Problem-Solving","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/7240","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"teheuxUnravellingUnderlyingProcesses2023","abstract":"Background: To deliver high-quality collaborative care, residents need to be trained across the boundaries of their medical specialty (intraprofessional learning). The current literature does not provide insights into the underlying processes that influence intraprofessional learning. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the processes that occur during intraprofessional workplace learning in residency training, by exploring everyday intraprofessional interactions experienced by residents, with the ultimate objective of improving collaborative practice.Method: We conducted a focused ethnography using field observations and in-depth interviews with residents at an academic children's hospital in the Netherlands. In 2022, nine residents from four different medical specialties were shadowed and/or interviewed. In total, >120 hours of observation and 10 interviews were conducted. Data collection and analysis were conducted iteratively and discussed in a research team with diverse perspectives, as well as with a sounding board group of stakeholders.Results: Residents were involved in numerous intraprofessional interactions as part of their daily work. We identified three themes that shed light on the underlying processes that occur during intraprofessional workplace learning: (1) residents' agency, (2) ingroups and outgroups and (3) communication about intraprofessional collaboration.Conclusions: Collaborative practice offers many intraprofessional learning opportunities but does not automatically result in learning from, with and about other specialties to improve intraprofessional collaborative care. Overarching the identified themes, we emphasise the pivotal role of the resident-supervisor dyad in facilitating residents' engagement in the learning opportunities of complex intraprofessional care. Furthermore, we propose that promoting deliberate practice and shared responsibility in collaborative care are crucial to better prepare residents for their roles and responsibilities in delivering high-quality collaborative patient care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Teheux","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Kuijer-Siebelink","given":"Wietske"},{"family":"Bus","given":"Lotte L."},{"family":"Draaisma","given":"Jos M.

By combining previous analyses of a dataset with new analyses of the processes of learning, patterns of successful and unsuccessful collaboration were identified. In this paper, the results of the application of a heuristics miner to utterances coded with the Decision-Function Coding Scheme, are combined withthe results of First Order Markov transitions and in-depth linguistic analysis of the discourse to analyse the processes of collaborative problem solving within a scenario-based virtual world. The analysis of dependency graphs extracted from students’ event logs revealed problem solving actions enacted by students, as well as the dependency relationships between these actions. The addition of in-depth linguistic analysis explained the micro-level discourse of students, producing the observable patterns. Integration of these findings with those previously reported added to the depth of our understanding about this complex learning environment.

  {"id":"thompsonUsingMicropatternsSpeech2013","abstract":"Learning analytics techniques are traditionally used on the \"big data\" collected at the course or university level. The application of such techniques to the data sets generated in complex learning environments can provide insights into the relationships between the design of learning environments, the processes of learning, and learning outcomes. In this paper, two of the codes described as part of the Collaborative Process Analysis Coding Scheme (CPACS) were extracted from the Math Data Corpus. The codes selected were tense and pronouns, both of which have been found to indicate phases of group work and the action associated with collaboration. Rather than examine these measures of social interactions in isolation, a framework for the analysis of complex learning environments was applied. This facilitated an analysis of the relationships between the social interactions, the task design and learning outcomes, as well as tool use. The generation of a successful problem solution of one expert and one non-expert group was accurately predicted (75%-94%). The examination of interactions between the social, epistemic and tool elements of the learning environment for one group showed that successful role differentiation and participation were related to successful problem solutions in the first meeting. In the second meeting, these were less important. The relationship between the discourse related to problem resolution through action and the correctness of a problems solution was found to be less reliable measures, however further analysis is needed at a finer grain to investigate this finding. A rich description of the processes of learning (with regards to social interaction, generation of knowledge, and discourse related to action) was generated for one group.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Kate"}],"citation-key":"thompsonUsingMicropatternsSpeech2013","collection-title":"ICMI '13","container-title":"Proceedings of the 15th ACM on International conference on multimodal interaction","DOI":"10.1145/2522848.2533792","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2129-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,9]]},"page":"591–598","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Using micro-patterns of speech to predict the correctness of answers to mathematics problems: an exercise in multimodal learning analytics","title-short":"Using micro-patterns of speech to predict the correctness of answers to mathematics problems","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/2522848.2533792"},

Based on a series of consultations with senior managers from 83 different higher education institutions in 24 European countries, we observe that LA is primarily perceived as a tool to enhance teaching and institutional management. As a result, teaching and support staff are found to be the main users of LA and the target audience of training support. In contrast, there is little evidence of active engagement with students or using LA to develop self-regulated learning skills.

  {"id":"vatralUsingDiCoTFramework2022","abstract":"Simulation-based training (SBT) programs are commonly employed by organizations to train individuals and teams for effective workplace cognitive and psychomotor skills in a broad range of applications. Distributed cognition has become a popular cognitive framework for the design and evaluation of these SBT environments, with structured methodologies such as\n              Distributed Cognition for Teamwork (DiCoT)\n              used for analysis. However, the analysis and evaluations generated by such distributed cognition frameworks require extensive domain-knowledge and manual coding and interpretation, and the analysis is primarily qualitative. In this work, we propose and develop the application of multimodal learning analysis techniques to SBT scenarios. Using these analysis methods, we can use the rich multimodal data collected in SBT environments to generate more automated interpretations of trainee performance that supplement and extend traditional DiCoT analysis. To demonstrate the use of these methods, we present a case study of nurses training in a mixed-reality manikin-based (MRMB) training environment. We show how the combined analysis of the video, speech, and eye-tracking data collected as the nurses train in the MRMB environment supports and enhances traditional qualitative DiCoT analysis. By applying such quantitative data-driven analysis methods, we can better analyze trainee activities online in SBT and MRMB environments. With continued development, these analysis methods could be used to provide targeted feedback to learners, a detailed review of training performance to the instructors, and data-driven evidence for improving the environment to simulation designers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Vatral","given":"Caleb"},{"family":"Biswas","given":"Gautam"},{"family":"Cohn","given":"Clayton"},{"family":"Davalos","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Mohammed","given":"Naveeduddin"}],"citation-key":"vatralUsingDiCoTFramework2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence","container-title-short":"Front.

Our system takes continuous body motion and gaze behaviour data as its input. The data is recorded using a full body motion tracking suit and a wearable eye tracker.

  {"id":"viswanathanUsingTabletGestures2018","abstract":"Effective collaboration between student peers is not spontaneous. A system that can measure collaboration in real-time may be useful, as it could alert an instructor to pairs that need help in collaborating effectively. We tested whether superficial measures of speech and user interface actions would suffice for measuring collaboration. Pairs of students solved complex math problems while data were collected in the form of verbal interaction and user action logs from the students tablets. We distinguished four classifications of interactivity: collaboration, cooperation, high asymmetric contribution and low asymmetric contribution. Human coders used richer data (several video streams) to choose one of these codes for each episode. Thousands of features were extracted computationally from the log and audio data. Machine learning was used to induce a detector that also assigned a code to each episode as a function of these features. Detectors for combinations of codes were induced as well. The best detector's overall accuracy was 96 percent (kappa 0.92) compared to human coding. This high level of agreement suggests that superficial features of speech and log data do suffice for measuring collaboration. However, these results should be viewed as preliminary because the particular task may have made it relatively easy to distinguish collaboration from cooperation.","author":[{"family":"Viswanathan","given":"Sree Aurovindh"},{"family":"VanLehn","given":"Kurt"}],"citation-key":"viswanathanUsingTabletGestures2018","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","DOI":"10/gds4fq","ISSN":"1939-1382","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"230-242","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Using the Tablet Gestures and Speech of Pairs of Students to Classify Their Collaboration","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

However, our understanding of this complex and dynamic phenomenon is still limited. Here, we examine unimodal primitives (activity on the screen, speech, and body movements), and their multimodal combinations during remote CPS. We analyze two datasets where 116 triads collaboratively engaged in a challenging visual programming task using video conferencing software. We investigate how UI-interactions, behavioral primitives, and multimodal patterns were associated with teams' subjective and objective performance outcomes. We found that idling with limited speech (i.e., silence or backchannel feedback only) and without movement was negatively correlated with task performance and with participants' subjective perceptions of the collaboration. However, being silent and focused during solution execution was positively correlated with task performance. Results illustrate that in some cases, multimodal patterns improved the predictions and improved explanatory power over the unimodal primitives. We discuss how the findings can inform the design of real-time interventions for remote CPS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Vrzakova","given":"Hana"},{"family":"Amon","given":"Mary Jean"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Duran","given":"Nicholas D."},{"family":"D'Mello","given":"Sidney K."}],"citation-key":"vrzakovaFocusedStuckTogether2020","collection-title":"LAK '20","container-title":"Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge","DOI":"10.1145/3375462.3375467","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-7712-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"295–304","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Focused or stuck together: multimodal patterns reveal triads' performance in collaborative problem solving","title-short":"Focused or stuck together","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3375462.3375467"},

The aim of this study is to explore the potential of a temporal perspective to broaden understanding of the effects of table shape on collaboration when different group sizes and genders are considered. On-task actions such as explanation, discussion, non-verbal interaction, and interaction with physical artefacts were observed while students were engaged in engineering design tasks.

Extending the participatory sensing model, this paper explores the prospect of utilizing social networks as sensor networks, which gives rise to an interesting reliable sensing problem. In this problem, individuals are represented by sensors (data sources) who occasionally make observations about the physical world. These observations may be true or false, and hence are viewed as binary claims. The reliable sensing problem is to determine the correctness of reported observations. From a networked sensing standpoint, what makes this sensing problem formulation different is that, in the case of human participants, not only is the reliability of sources usually unknown but also the original data provenance may be uncertain. Individuals may report observations made by others as their own. The contribution of this paper lies in developing a model that considers the impact of such information sharing on the analytical foundations of reliable sensing, and embed it into a tool called Apollo that uses Twitter as a “sensor network” for observing events in the physical world. Evaluation, using Twitter-based case-studies, shows good correspondence between observations deemed correct by Apollo and ground truth.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Amin","given":"Md Tanvir"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shen"},{"family":"Abdelzaher","given":"Tarek"},{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Lance"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Siyu"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Chenji"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hengchang"},{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Charu C."},{"family":"Ganti","given":"Raghu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xinlei"},{"family":"Mohapatra","given":"Prasant"},{"family":"Szymanski","given":"Boleslaw"},{"family":"Le","given":"Hieu"}],"citation-key":"wangUsingHumansSensors2014","container-title":"IPSN-14 Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","DOI":"10.1109/IPSN.2014.6846739","event-title":"IPSN-14 Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4]]},"page":"35-46","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Using humans as sensors: An estimation-theoretic perspective","title-short":"Using humans as sensors","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"wiseVisionsCSCLEight2017","abstract":"The field of CSCL is at a critical moment in its development. Internally we face issues of fragmentation and questions about what progress is being made. Externally the rise of social media and a variety of research communities that study the interactions within it raise questions about our unique identity and larger impact on the world. To illuminate the complex issues involved and the multiple perspectives that exist on them, we conducted an iterative and generative consultation with members of the CSCL community through individual interviews and public interactive presentations. The result is a series of eight provocations for the field, each presented as a dialogue between the Provocateur/Provocatrice (who seeks to shake up the status quo) and the Conciliator (who seeks to build on the achievements of our current traditions). The provocations address the debated need for six things: one conceptual framework to unite our diverse tools and theories (#1), prioritization of learner agency over collaborative scripting (#2), scrupulous scrutiny of when “collaboration” and “community” are said to exist (#3), the pursuit of computational approaches to understand collaborative learning (#5), learning analytics and adaptive support to be a top priority in the field (#6), and the expansion of our focus to seriously address social media and large-scale learning environments (#7). In addition, the provocations highlight two areas in which perhaps we should desist: the attempt to reconcile analytical and interpretative approaches to understanding collaboration (#4), and the goal of achieving tangible change in the education system (#8). There are no resolutions offered in this paper; the interchanges presented are designed to lay out the complex constellation of issues involved and can be considered a dialogue that we are still in the process of having with ourselves as individuals and together as a community.

There is danger, however, in thinking that with enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. In fact, with larger amounts of data, theory plays an ever-more critical role in analysis. In this introduction to the special section on learning analytics and learning theory we describe some critical problems in the analysis of large-scale data that occur when theory is not involved. These range from the question of to which of the many possible variables a researcher should attend to how to interpret a multitude of micro-results and make them actionable. We conclude our comments with a discussion of how the collection of empirical papers included in the special section and the commentaries that were invited on them speak to these challenges, and in doing so represent important steps towards theory-informed and theory-contributing learning analytics work. Our ultimate goal is to provoke a critical dialogue in the field about the ways in which learning analytics work draws on and contributes to theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Wise","given":"Alyssa Friend"},{"family":"Shaffer","given":"David Williamson"}],"citation-key":"wiseWhyTheoryMatters2015","container-title":"Journal of Learning Analytics","DOI":"10.18608/jla.2015.22.2","ISSN":"1929-7750","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,7]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2015 Journal of Learning Analytics","number":"2","page":"5-13","source":"learning-analytics.info","title":"Why Theory Matters More than Ever in the Age of Big Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/4677","volume":"2"},

In this paper, we present an intervention study in ‘Move, Idioms!’, a mobile‐assisted Chinese language learning approach that emphasizes contextualized learner content creation and meaning (sense) making with their daily encounters. In the study, students used smart phones on a 1:1 basis to take photos of the real‐life contexts pertaining to Chinese idioms or conjunctions, made sentences with the idioms/conjunctions, and then posted them onto a wiki space for peer reviews.

  {"id":"worsleyDesigningAnalyticsCollaboration2021","abstract":"Collaboration has garnered global attention as an important skill for the 21st century. While researchers have been doing work on collaboration for nearly a century, many of the questions that the field is investigating overlook the need for students to learn how to read and respond to different collaborative settings. Existing research focuses on chronicling the various factors that predict the effectiveness of a collaborative experience, or on changing user behaviour in the moment. These are worthwhile research endeavours for developing our theoretical understanding of collaboration. However, there is also a need to centre student perceptions and experiences with collaboration as an important area of inquiry. Based on a survey of 131 university students, we find that student collaboration-related concerns can be represented across seven different categories or dimensions: Climate, Compatibility, Communication, Conflict, Context, Contribution, and Constructive. These categories extend prior research on collaboration and can help the field ensure that future collaboration analytics tools are designed to support the ways that students think about and utilize collaboration. Finally, we describe our instantiation of many of these dimensions in our collaborative analytics tool, BLINC, and suggest that these seven dimensions can be instructive for re-orienting the Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and collaboration analytics communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Worsley","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Khalil"},{"family":"Melo","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Jang","given":"JooYoung"}],"citation-key":"worsleyDesigningAnalyticsCollaboration2021","container-title":"Journal of Learning Analytics","DOI":"10.18608/jla.2021.7242","ISSN":"1929-7750","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"30-48","publisher":"Society for Learning Analytics Research","source":"ERIC","title":"Designing Analytics for Collaboration Literacy and Student Empowerment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1295230","volume":"8"},

For many contemporary education researchers, participation in the video coding process serves as a rite of passage. However, recent developments in multimodal learning analytics may help to accelerate and enhance this process by providing researchers with a more nuanced glimpse into a set of learning experiences. As an example of how to use multimodal learning analytics towards these ends, this paper includes a preliminary analysis from 54 college students, who completed two engineering design tasks in pairs. Gesture, speech and electro-dermal activation data were collected as students completed these tasks. The gesture data was used to learn a set of canonical clusters (N=4). A decision tree was trained based on individual students' cluster frequencies, and pre-post learning gains. The nodes in the decision tree were then used to identify a subset of video segments that were human coded based on prior work in learning analytics and engineering design. The combination of machine learning and human inference helps elucidate the practices that seem to correlate with student learning. In particular, both engagement and disengagement seem to correlate with student learning, albeit in a somewhat nuanced fashion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Worsley","given":"Marcelo"}],"citation-key":"worsleyDisEngagementMatters2018","collection-title":"LAK '18","container-title":"Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge","DOI":"10.1145/3170358.3170420","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6400-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"365–369","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"(Dis)engagement matters: identifying efficacious learning practices with multimodal learning analytics","title-short":"(Dis)engagement matters","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3170358.3170420"},

Historically multimodal analyses of learning have been extremely laborious and time intensive. However, researchers have recently been exploring ways to use multimodal computational analysis in the service of studying how people learn in complex learning environments. In an effort to advance this research agenda, we present a comparative analysis of four different data segmentation techniques. In particular, we propose affect- and pose-based data segmentation, as alternatives to human-based segmentation, and fixed-window segmentation. In a study of ten dyads working on an open-ended engineering design task, we find that affect- and pose-based segmentation are more effective, than traditional approaches, for drawing correlations between learning-relevant constructs, and multimodal behaviors. We also find that pose-based segmentation outperforms the two more traditional segmentation strategies for predicting student success on the hands-on task.

We use video, audio, gesture and bio-physiology data from a two-condition study (N = 20), to identify correlations between the multimodal data, experimental condition, and two learning outcomes: design quality and learning. The three approaches incorporate: 1) human-annotated coding of video data, 2) automated coding of gesture, audio and bio-physiological data and, 3) concatenated human-annotated and automatically annotated data. Within each analysis we employ the same machine learning and sequence mining techniques. Ultimately we find that each approach provides different affordances depending on the similarity metric and the dependent variable. For example, the analysis based on human-annotated data found strong correlations among multimodal behaviors, experimental condition, success and learning, when we relaxed constraints on temporal similarity. The second approach performed well when comparing students’ multimodal behaviors as a time series, but was less effective using the temporally relaxed similarity metric. The take-away is that there are several strategies for doing multimodal learning analytics, and that many of these approaches can provide a meaningful glimpse into a complex data set, glimpses that may be difficult to identify using traditional approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Worsley","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Blikstein","given":"Paulo"}],"citation-key":"worsleyMultimodalAnalysisMaking2018","container-title":"International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education","container-title-short":"Int J Artif Intell Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s40593-017-0160-1","ISSN":"1560-4306","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"385-419","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Multimodal Analysis of Making","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-017-0160-1","volume":"28"},

Results reveal that four independently-motivated involvement categories (non-involved, disagreeing, amused, and other) show statistically significant associations with particular DAs. Further examination shows that involvement is associated with contextual features (such as the speaker or type of meeting), as well as with lexical features (such as utterance length and perplexity). Finally, we found (surprisingly) that perplexities are similar for involved and non-involved utterances. This suggests that it may not be the amount of propositional content, but rather participants' attitudes toward that content, that differentiates hot spots from other regions in a meeting.

  {"id":"yanMappingProximityTraces2022","abstract":"Identifying students facing difficulties and providing them with timely support is one of the educator's key responsibilities. Yet, this task is becoming increasingly challenging as the complexity of physical learning spaces grows, along with the emergence of novel educational technologies and classroom designs. There has been substantial research and development work focused on identifying student social behaviours in digital platforms (eg, the learning management system) as predictors of academic progression. However, little work has investigated such relationships in physical learning spaces. This study explores the potential of using wearable trackers for the early detection of low-progress students based on their social and spatial (socio-spatial) behaviours at the school. Positioning data from 98 primary school students and six teachers were automatically captured over a period of eight weeks. Fourteen socio-spatial behavioural features were extracted and processed using a set of machine learning classifiers to model students’ learning progression. Results illustrate the potential of prospectively identifying low-progress students from these features and the importance of adapting classroom learning analytics to differences in pedagogical designs. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Learning analytics research on predicting students’ academic progression is emerging in both digital and physical learning spaces. Students’ social behaviours in learning activities is a key factor in predicting their academic progression. Emerging sensing technologies can provide opportunities to study students’ real-time social behaviours in physical learning spaces. What this paper adds Fourteen progression-related socio-spatial behavioural features are extracted from students’ physical (x-y) positioning traces. Predictive learning analytics that achieved 81% accuracy in prospectively identifying low-progress students from their real-time socio-spatial behaviours. Empirical evidence to support the need for classroom learning analytics to have instructional sensitivity (ie, be calibrated according to the learning design). Implications for practice and/or policy Sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms can be used to capture and generate valuable insights about higher-order learning constructs (eg, performance and collaboration) from students' physical positioning traces in classrooms. Researchers and practitioners should be cautious with generalised classification algorithms and predictive learning analytics that do not account for the pedagogical differences between different subjects or learning designs. Researchers and practitioners should consider the potentially unforeseen ethical issues that can emerge in using sensing technologies and predictive learning analytics in authentic, physical classroom settings. © 2022 The Authors.

  {"id":"yanRoleIndoorPositioning2023","abstract":"Simulation-based learning provides students with unique opportunities to develop key procedural and teamwork skills in close-to-authentic physical learning and training environments. Yet, assessing students' performance in such situations can be challenging and mentally exhausting for teachers. Multimodal learning analytics can support the assessment of simulation-based learning by making salient aspects of students' activities visible for evaluation. Although descriptive analytics have been used to study students' motor behaviours in simulation-based learning, their validity and utility for assessing performance remain unclear. This study aims at addressing this knowledge gap by investigating how indoor positioning analytics can be used to generate meaningful insights about students' tasks and collaboration performance in simulation-based learning. We collected and analysed the positioning data of 304 healthcare students, organised in 76 teams, through correlation, predictive and epistemic network analyses. The primary findings were (1) large correlations between students' spatial-procedural behaviours and their group performances; (2) predictive learning analytics that achieved an acceptable level (0.74 AUC) in distinguishing between low-performing and high-performing teams regarding collaboration performance; and (3) epistemic networks that can be used for assessing the behavioural differences across multiple teams. We also present the teachers' qualitative evaluation of the utility of these analytics and implications for supporting formative assessment in simulation-based learning. Practitioner notes What is currently known about this topic Assessing students' performance in simulation-based learning is often challenging and mentally exhausting. The combination of learning analytics and sensing technologies has the potential to uncover meaningful behavioural insights in physical learning spaces. Observational studies have suggested the potential value of analytics extracted from positioning data as indicators of highly-effective behaviour in simulation-based learning. What this paper adds Indoor positioning analytics for supporting teachers' formative assessment and timely feedback on students' group/team-level performance in simulation-based learning. Empirical evidence supported the potential use of epistemic networks for assessing the behavioural differences between low-performing and high-performing teams. Teachers' positively validated the utility of indoor positioning analytics in supporting reflective practices and formative assessment in simulation-based learning. Implications for practitioners Indoor positioning tracking and spatial analysis can be used to investigate students' teamwork and task performance in simulation-based learning.

  {"id":"yanScalabilitySustainabilityEthicality2022","abstract":"Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) innovations are commonly aimed at supporting learners in physical learning spaces through state-of-the-art sensing technologies and analysis techniques. Although a growing body of MMLA research has demonstrated the potential benefits of sensor-based technologies in education, whether their use can be scalable, sustainable, and ethical remains questionable. Such uncertainty can limit future research and the potential adoption of MMLA by educational stakeholders in authentic learning situations. To address this, we systematically reviewed the methodological, operational, and ethical challenges faced by current MMLA works that can affect the scalability and sustainability of future MMLA innovations. A total of 96 peer-reviewed articles published after 2010 were included. The findings were summarised into three recommendations, including i) improving reporting standards by including sufficient details about sensors, analysis techniques, and the full disclosure of evaluation metrics, ii) fostering interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in learning analytics, software, and hardware engineering to develop affordable sensors and upgrade MMLA innovations that used discontinued technologies, and iii) developing ethical guidelines to address the potential risks of bias, privacy, and equality concerns with using MMLA innovations. Through these future research directions, MMLA can remain relevant and eventually have actual impacts on educational practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Lixiang"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Linxuan"},{"family":"Gasevic","given":"Dragan"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"yanScalabilitySustainabilityEthicality2022","collection-title":"LAK22","container-title":"LAK22: 12th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3506860.3506862","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9573-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,21]]},"page":"13–23","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Scalability, Sustainability, and Ethicality of Multimodal Learning Analytics","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3506860.3506862"},

This study aims to explore how phases of CoRL and SSRL (planning, task understanding, strategy use, evaluation) occur in relation to KC in collaborative interactions. Secondary school students (N = 34) were videotaped while collaborating in groups of three to four. Their task was to create a poster about “center of gravity” using an interactive tabletop. In the analysis, video data were coded for KC phases and phases of CoRL and SSRL. Process mining was applied to visualize sequential associations between KC and regulation as process maps. This was complemented by qualitative examples illustrating these associations in interactions. Results revealed that KC and regulation manifested either simultaneously via the same talk or interaction or prompted or followed one another. Group-level regulation guided, and supported KC. Current study contributes to CSCL research by demonstrating reciprocal relationships between KC and group-level regulation and the importance of regulation for collaboration. It also provides implications for designing pedagogical tools to support regulation and KC and advancing analytical methods that enable tracking CSCL processes for its better understanding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zabolotna","given":"Kateryna"},{"family":"Malmberg","given":"Jonna"},{"family":"Järvenoja","given":"Hanna"}],"citation-key":"zabolotnaExaminingInterplayKnowledge2023","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2022.107494","ISSN":"0747-5632","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"page":"107494","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Examining the interplay of knowledge construction and group-level regulation in a computer-supported collaborative learning physics task","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563222003144","volume":"138"},
  {"id":"zamecnikCohesionSmallGroups2022","abstract":"The development of group cohesion for small groups in face-to-face educational learning settings has been widely studied for decades. The calibre of group cohesion within these contexts is typically associated with increases in performance, resulting in a productive collaboration that helps drive knowledge building and innovation within a learning environment. However, understanding and measuring cohesion in technology-mediated learning experiences still requires additional research. This paper reports on a systematic literature review of small groups in technology-mediated learning settings to explore the definitions of cohesion and the methodologies used for the measurements that have been identified arising in this area. Furthermore, the review provides a characterization of the factors that impact collaborative learning in computer-supported environments, highlighting two important aspects: i) there is a significant gap in measuring cohesion using unobtrusive methods, such as relying on log or trace data and ii) there is a lack of longitudinal approaches to understand the emergence of cohesion. Finally, we discuss implications for future research in studying group cohesion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Zamecnik","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Villa-Torrano","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Kovanović","given":"Vitomir"},{"family":"Grossmann","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Joksimović","given":"Srećko"},{"family":"Dimitriadis","given":"Yannis"},{"family":"Pardo","given":"Abelardo"}],"citation-key":"zamecnikCohesionSmallGroups2022","container-title":"Educational Research Review","container-title-short":"Educational Research Review","DOI":"10/gpgpb7","ISSN":"1747938X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2]]},"language":"en","page":"100427","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The cohesion of small groups in technology-mediated learning environments: A systematic literature review","title-short":"The cohesion of small groups in technology-mediated learning environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1747938X21000506","volume":"35"},

Drawing on a theme that characterizes work practices in collaborative work settings—reading a scene—we examine both vocal and non-vocal actions (e.g., speech, body movement, gesture, gaze) of team members participating in this task to understand how these actions are used to display status of one’s work or to acquire information about the work status of others. While each action modality was helpful in constructing awareness to some extent, it posed different challenges, requiring team members to combine both vocal and non-vocal actions to achieve awareness about each other’s activities and their temporal order. We conclude by discussing different types of non-vocal actions, their purpose, and the need for computational support in this dynamic work setting.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhan"},{"family":"Sarcevic","given":"Aleksandra"}],"citation-key":"zhangConstructingAwarenessSpeech2015","container-title":"ECSCW 2015: Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 19-23 September 2015, Oslo, Norway","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-20499-4_9","editor":[{"family":"Boulus-Rødje","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Ellingsen","given":"Gunnar"},{"family":"Bratteteig","given":"Tone"},{"family":"Aanestad","given":"Margunn"},{"family":"Bjørn","given":"Pernille"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-20499-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"163-182","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Constructing Awareness Through Speech, Gesture, Gaze and Movement During a Time-Critical Medical Task","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"zhaoAutomatedTranscribingCoding2024","abstract":"Effective collaboration and teamwork skills are critical in high-risk sectors, as deficiencies in these areas can result in injuries and risk of death. To foster the growth of these vital skills, immersive learning spaces have been created to simulate real-world scenarios, enabling students to safely improve their teamwork abilities. In such learning environments, multiple dialogue segments can occur concurrently as students independently organise themselves to tackle tasks in parallel across diverse spatial locations. This complex situation creates challenges for educators in assessing teamwork and for students in reflecting on their performance, especially considering the importance of effective communication in embodied teamwork. To address this, we propose an automated approach for generating teamwork analytics based on spatial and speech data. We illustrate this approach within a dynamic, immersive healthcare learning environment centred on embodied teamwork. Moreover, we evaluated whether the automated approach can produce transcriptions and epistemic networks of spatially distributed dialogue segments with a quality comparable to those generated manually for research objectives. This paper makes two key contributions: (1) it proposes an approach that integrates automated speech recognition and natural language processing techniques to automate the transcription and coding of team communication and generate analytics; and (2) it provides analyses of the errors in outputs generated by those techniques, offering insights for researchers and practitioners involved in the design of similar systems.Practitioner notesWhat is currently known about this topic Immersive learning environments simulate real-world situations, helping students improve their teamwork skills. In these settings, students can have multiple simultaneous conversations while working together on tasks at different physical locations. The dynamic nature of these interactions makes it hard for teachers to assess teamwork and communication and for students to reflect on their performance. What this paper adds We propose a method that employs multimodal learning analytics for automatically generating teamwork-related insights into the content of student conversations. This data processing method allows for automatically transcribing and coding spatially distributed dialogue segments generated from students working in teams in an immersive learning environment and enables downstream analysis. This approach uses spatial analytics, natural language processing and automated speech recognition techniques. Implications for practitioners Automated coding of dialogue segments among team members can help create analytical tools to assist in evaluating and reflecting on teamwork. By analysing spatial and speech data, it is possible to apply learning analytics advancements to support teaching and learning in fast-paced physical learning spaces where students can freely engage with one another.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Linxuan"},{"family":"Gašević","given":"Dragan"},{"family":"Swiecki","given":"Zachari"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuheng"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jionghao"},{"family":"Sha","given":"Lele"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Lixiang"},{"family":"Alfredo","given":"Riordan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xinyu"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"zhaoAutomatedTranscribingCoding2024","container-title":"British Journal of Educational Technology","DOI":"10.1111/bjet.13476","ISSN":"1467-8535","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","page":"1673-1702","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Towards automated transcribing and coding of embodied teamwork communication through multimodal learning analytics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjet.13476","volume":"55"},

The spatial patterns adopted by team members in terms of where in the physical space they are standing, and who their body is oriented to, can be key in analysing and increasing the quality of interaction during such face-to-face situations. In this paper, we model the students’ communication based on spatial (positioning) and audio (voice detection) data captured from 92 students working in teams of four in the context of healthcare simulation. We extract non-verbal events (i.e., total speaking time, overlapped speech,and speech responses to team members and teachers) and investigate to what extent they can serve as meaningful indicators of students’ performance according to teachers’ learning intentions. The contribution of this paper to multimodal learning analytics includes: i) a generic method to semi-automatically model communication in a setting where students can freely move in the learning space; and ii) results from a mixed-methods analysis of non-verbal indicators of team communication with respect to teachers’ learning design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Linxuan"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Lixiang"},{"family":"Gasevic","given":"Dragan"},{"family":"Dix","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Jaggard","given":"Hollie"},{"family":"Wotherspoon","given":"Rosie"},{"family":"Alfredo","given":"Riordan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xinyu"},{"family":"Martinez-Maldonado","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"zhaoModellingColocatedTeam2022","collection-title":"LAK22","container-title":"LAK22: 12th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3506860.3506935","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9573-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"370–380","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Modelling Co-located Team Communication from Voice Detection and Positioning Data in Healthcare Simulation","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3506860.3506935"},
  {"id":"zhengKnowledgeConstructionProblemBased2023","abstract":"Phenomenon: Problem-based learning (PBL) has been widely adopted in medical schools across the globe. However, the dynamics of discourse moves in time sequences during such learning remain underexplored. This study investigated discourse moves used by PBL tutors and tutees to facilitate collaborative knowledge construction, and adopted sequential analysis to unpack the temporal dynamics of such moves during PBL knowledge construction in an Asian context. Approach: This study’s sample comprised 22 first-year medical students and two PBL tutors at an Asian medical school. Two 2-h PBL tutorials were video-recorded and transcribed, and notes were made about the participants’ non-verbal behaviors, including but not limited to body language and technology use. Descriptive statistics and visual representations were used to discern participation patterns as they evolved over time, and discourse analysis was applied to identify specific types of teacher and student discourse moves within knowledge construction. Lastly, lag-sequential analysis (LSA) was adopted to understand the sequential patterns of those discourse moves. Findings: The PBL tutors mainly used probing questions, explanation and clarification, compliments, encouragement, affirmation, and requests when facilitating PBL discussions. LSA revealed that discourse moves had the following four major paths. Teachers’ content-related questions elicited both lower- and higher-level thinking from students; teachers’ statements mediated between students’ thinking levels and teachers’ questions; there were relationships among teachers’ social-facilitation discourse, students’ thinking modes, and teachers’ statements; and there was a sequential relationship among teachers’ statements, students’ facilitation, teachers’ process-related discourse, and students’ silences. Insights: This study revealed the importance of using probing questions to facilitate students’ knowledge construction as they proceeded from lower- to higher-level thinking. This study also fills a gap in the current literature by adopting the innovative LSA methodology to explore teachers’ and students’ discourse move sequences in PBL. The results have important practical implications for PBL tutors regarding when and how to facilitate their students’ collaborative knowledge construction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Binbin"},{"family":"He","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Junru"}],"citation-key":"zhengKnowledgeConstructionProblemBased2023","container-title":"Teaching and Learning in Medicine","DOI":"10.1080/10401334.2023.2230559","ISSN":"1040-1334","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7]]},"page":"1-14","PMID":"37409881","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Knowledge Construction in Problem-Based Learning: A Lag-Sequential Analysis of Teachers’ and Students’ Discourse Moves","title-short":"Knowledge Construction in Problem-Based Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10401334.2023.2230559","volume":"0"},

This research used the Math Data Corpus, which contains time-synchronized multimodal data from collaborating students as they jointly solved problems varying in difficulty. The aim was to investigate how reliably pen signal features, which were extracted as students wrote with digital pens and paper, could identify which student in a group was the dominant domain expert. An additional aim was to improve prediction of expertise based on joint bootstrapping of empirical science and machine learning techniques. To accomplish this, empirical analyses first identified which data partitioning and pen signal features were most reliably associated with expertise. Then alternative machine learning techniques compared classification accuracies based on all pen features, versus empirically selected ones. The best unguided classification accuracy was 70.8%, which improved to 83.3% with empirical guidance. These results demonstrate that handwriting signal features can predict domain expertise in math with high reliability.

  {"id":"zhouDetectingNonverbalSpeech2024","abstract":"Collaboration is argued to be an important skill, not only in schools and higher education contexts but also in the workspace and other aspects of life. However, simply asking students to work together as a group on a task does not guarantee success in collaboration. Effective collaborative learning requires meaningful interactions among individuals in a group. Recent advances in multimodal data collection tools and AI provide unique opportunities to analyze, model and support these interactions. This study proposes an original method to identify group interactions in real-world collaborative learning activities and investigates the variations in interactions of groups with different collaborative learning outcomes. The study was conducted in a 10-week long post-graduate course involving 34 students with data collected from groups’ weekly collaborative learning interactions lasting ~ 60 min per session. The results showed that groups with different levels of shared understanding exhibit significant differences in time spent and maximum duration of referring and following behaviours. Further analysis using process mining techniques revealed that groups with different outcomes exhibit different patterns of group interactions. A loop between students’ referring and following behaviours and resource management behaviours was identified in groups with better collaborative learning outcomes. The study indicates that the nonverbal behaviours studied here, which can be auto-detected with advanced computer vision techniques and multimodal data, have the potential to distinguish groups with different collaborative learning outcomes. Insights generated can also support the practice of collaborative learning for learners and educators. Further research should explore the cross-context validity of the proposed distinctions and explore the approach’s potential to be developed as a real-world, real-time support system for collaborative learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Suraworachet","given":"Wannapon"},{"family":"Cukurova","given":"Mutlu"}],"citation-key":"zhouDetectingNonverbalSpeech2024","container-title":"Education and Information Technologies","container-title-short":"Educ Inf Technol","DOI":"10.1007/s10639-023-12315-1","ISSN":"1573-7608","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1071-1098","source":"Springer Link","title":"Detecting non-verbal speech and gaze behaviours with multimodal data and computer vision to interpret effective collaborative learning interactions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-023-12315-1","volume":"29"}
