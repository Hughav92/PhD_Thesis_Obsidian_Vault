  {"id":"blakePerceptionHumanMotion2007","abstract":"Abstract  Humans, being highly social creatures, rely heavily on the ability to perceive what others are doing and to infer from gestures and expressions what others may be intending to do. These perceptual skills are easily mastered by most, but not all, people, in large part because human action readily communicates intentions and feelings. In recent years, remarkable advances have been made in our understanding of the visual, motoric, and affective influences on perception of human action, as well as in the elucidation of the neural concomitants of perception of human action. This article reviews those advances and, where possible, draws links among those findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Blake","given":"Randolph"},{"family":"Shiffrar","given":"Maggie"}],"citation-key":"blakePerceptionHumanMotion2007","container-title":"Annual Review of Psychology","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"f046d69be856603f4f65a3fbb95acdc08cfb5280","abstract":"Motion-induced position shifts constitute a broad class of visual illusions in which motion and position signals interact in the human visual pathway. In such illusions, the presence of visual motion distorts the perceived positions of objects in nearby space. Predictive mechanisms, which could contribute to compensating for processing delays due to neural transmission, have been given as an explanation. However, such mechanisms have struggled to explain why we do not usually perceive objects extrapolated beyond the end of their trajectory. Advocates of this interpretation have proposed a \"correction-for-extrapolation\" mechanism to explain this: When the object motion ends abruptly, this mechanism corrects the overextrapolation by shifting the perceived object location backwards to its actual location. However, such a mechanism has so far not been empirically demonstrated. Here, we use a novel version of the flash-grab illusion to demonstrate this mechanism. In the flash-grab effect, a target is flashed on a moving background that abruptly changes direction, leading to the mislocalization of the target. Here, we manipulate the angle of the direction change to dissociate the contributions of the background motion before and after the flash. Consistent with previous reports, we observe that perceptual mislocalization in the flash-grab illusion is mainly driven by motion after the flash. Importantly, however, we reveal a small but consistent mislocalization component in the direction opposite to the direction of the first motion sequence. This provides empirical support for the proposed correction-for-extrapolation mechanism, and therefore corroborates the interpretation that motion-induced position shifts might result from predictive interactions between motion and position signals.","author":[{"family":"Blom","given":"Tessel"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Qianchen"},{"family":"Hogendoorn","given":"Hinze"}],"citation-key":"f046d69be856603f4f65a3fbb95acdc08cfb5280","container-title":"Journal of Vision","container-title-short":"Journal of Vision","DOI":"10.1167/19.2.3","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,6]]},"language":"en","page":"1-11","PMID":"30725096","title":"When predictions fail: Correction for extrapolation in the flash-grab effect","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f046d69be856603f4f65a3fbb95acdc08cfb5280","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"stevensMovingMusicScaling2009","abstract":"TIME-KEEPING AMONG DANCERS WAS INVESTIGATED by measuring a dancer's movement in the presence and absence of music. If an internal clock was at work, then change from the ideal would manifest as scaling---consistently faster or slower unaccompanied performance; if time differences were due to lapsing, then sections from the with-music condition would be deleted, or material would be inserted into the no-music condition. Motion was recorded during ensemble performances of a four-minute choreographed piece with and without music. The median of 24 markers in the height dimension was analyzed for scaling and lapsing. Twenty percent of the variance was accounted for by sporadic scaling. Lapses---insertions and deletions---accounted for nearly all the speeding up---10.45 of 14 s. As in musical performance of memorized material, lapsing rather than scaling accounted for timing variations. Automation of lapsing and scaling detection has application in the analysis of music and dance time series data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Stevens","given":"Catherine J."},{"family":"Schubert","given":"Emery"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Kroos","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Halovic","given":"Shaun"}],"citation-key":"stevensMovingMusicScaling2009","container-title":"Music Perception","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2009.26.5.451","ISSN":"0730-7829, 1533-8312","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"451-464","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Moving with and Without Music: Scaling and Lapsing in Time in the Performance of Contemporary Dance","title-short":"Moving with and Without Music","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/26/5/451/62434/Moving-with-and-Without-Music-Scaling-and-Lapsing","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"warburtonMeasuringMotiontophotonLatency2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            Consumer virtual reality (VR) systems are increasingly being deployed in research to study sensorimotor behaviors, but properties of such systems require verification before being used as scientific tools. The ‘motion-to-photon’ latency (the lag between a user making a movement and the movement being displayed within the display) is a particularly important metric as temporal delays can degrade sensorimotor performance. Extant approaches to quantifying this measure have involved the use of bespoke software and hardware and produce a single measure of latency and ignore the effect of the motion prediction algorithms used in modern VR systems. This reduces confidence in the generalizability of the results. We developed a novel, system-independent, high-speed camera-based latency measurement technique to co-register real and virtual controller movements, allowing assessment of how latencies change through a movement. We applied this technique to measure the motion-to-photon latency of controller movements in the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Oculus Rift S, and Valve Index, using the Unity game engine and SteamVR. For the start of a sudden movement, all measured headsets had mean latencies between 21 and 42 ms. Once motion prediction could account for the inherent delays, the latency was functionally reduced to 2–13 ms, and our technique revealed that this reduction occurs within ~25–58 ms of movement onset. Our findings indicate that sudden accelerations (e.g., movement onset, impacts, and direction changes) will increase latencies and lower spatial accuracy. Our technique allows researchers to measure these factors and determine the impact on their experimental design before collecting sensorimotor data from VR systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Warburton","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Mon-Williams","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Mushtaq","given":"Faisal"},{"family":"Morehead","given":"J.
