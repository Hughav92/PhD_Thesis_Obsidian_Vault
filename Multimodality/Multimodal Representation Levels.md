[[@christodoulouMultimodalMusicDatasets2024]] provide the following schematic of the relationship between [[Physical Quantity|physical signals]], their [[Digital Signal|digital representations]], and their [[Perceptual Modality|cognitive perception]]:

I'm not sure that I entirely agree with this representation. A [[Digital Signal|digital representation]] must always be transformed back into a [[Physical Quantity|physical signal]] before it can be perceived. In fact, this is where a lot of the power of [[Digital Signal|digital representations]] lie. An [[Digital Audio Signal|audio signal]] can be transformed into [[Light|light]] through [[Visualisation|visualisation]] of the waveform. Likewise, an [[Digital Image Signal|image]] can be transformed into [[Sound|sound]] through [[Sonification|sonification]]. And through [[Data Fusion|data fusion]], we can combine various [[Digital Signal|digital representations]] of [[Physical Quantity|physical signals]] into a new form of [[Digital Signal|digital representation]] through which its perception can offer information beyond any of the individual signals. #multimodal #representation #signals #perception #analog-signal #digital-signal
