I'm Hugh and this is the open-source site for my PhD thesis. My project is preliminarily titled "Data Fusion for the Analysis of Multimodal Musicking Datasets" and is centred on developing a [[Methods vs Methodology|methodological]] framework for the analysis of [[Music Datasets vs Musicking Datasets|musicking datasets]] consisting of multiple data modalities, with focus on the representation of spatial and temporal information in fused data. I am carrying out this project at the [RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/) at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), Norway under the supervision of [Alexander Refsum Jensenius](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/people/management/alexanje/). The project began on 01.09.2024 and is intended to run until 01.09.2027.

This site encompasses everything that I am writing as part of the project, from the formal writing of the PhD thesis and article manuscripts to informal memos, notes, reflections, as well as literature overviews and databases, with the goal that this function as a knowledge base that I accumulate over the course of the project. In fact, it is a published version of the [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/) that I am using as my main writing tool and is primarily a collection of Markdown pages, with the Markdown source available on [my Github](https://github.com/Hughav92/PhD_Thesis_Obsidian_Vault). As a result this site represents a continuously evolving work-in-progress, and will be updated daily over the project period.

The publishing of the process of writing a PhD thesis is intended to be part of the [Open Science](https://www.openscience.no/en/what-open-science) encouraged by the University of Oslo. Although we make our results open through the open publishing of all research results through the University of Oslo's [DUO](https://www.duo.uio.no/) repository and the release of data, analysis source code, and methodologies, the process of conducting research can still remain a bit of a black box. With this site, I hope to open the process of writing a PhD, at least to a small extent.

I aim to share as much as I can. However, some of the contents of my personal version of this vault contain copyrighted or sensitive material, which may account for several dead links in this site.
