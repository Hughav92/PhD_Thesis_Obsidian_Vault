#my-work #presentation

This note contains an overview of presentations that I have prepared. My general method involves preparing an outline of slides and keywords, after which I prepare a script for the presentation. Based upon this script, I then prepare slides the slides which correspond to sections of the script. This can be quite non-linear, however each presentation page shows these as separate sections. For some venues, however, I just prepare slides and talk freely based upon these.
