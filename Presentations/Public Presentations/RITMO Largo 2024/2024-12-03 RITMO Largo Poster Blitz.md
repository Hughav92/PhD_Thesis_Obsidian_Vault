To develop a methodological and conceptual framework for the analysis of multimodal musicking datasets to aid in cross- and interdisciplinary collaboration, with focus on how spatial and temporal information is represented across multiple modalities and fused representations
- 
	- Music research is extremely interdisciplinary:
		- Disciplines have different:
			- Methodological approaches towards working with data
			- Theoretical understandings of data and how this is linked to constructs at focus of research
			- Analytical methods used to obtain information and draw conclusions from musicking datasets
	- Datasets are increasingly multimodal:
		- Many methods result in fused representations of data
		- How do these methods relate fused data to the constructs they attempt to measure?
			- Especially in terms of extraction of temporal and spatial information

- One large image which conveys the following:
	- Multiple data modalities involved
	- Fusion occurring
	- Data representation changes

### Draft 1

My name is Hugh von Arnim and I have recently started my PhD at RITMO with a project titled Data Fusion for the Analysis of Multimodal Musicking Datasets. This project is based upon two central strands. First, that research on musicking events is incredibly interdisciplinary and second, that this research is increasingly working with data obtained from a broad range of sensing devices in the form of large multimodal datasets. Various analytical methods applied to extract information from these datasets result in fused representations of the individual data modalities.

These various disciplines approach working with multimodal data quite heterogeneously, from the methods employed, to the wider methodological approaches, to the theoretical groundings towards the data which link the information extracted to the constructs measured. This can lead to challenges for inter- and cross-disciplinary work.

Therefore, my project aims to develop a methodological and conceptual framework for the analysis of multimodal musicking datasets to aid in cross- and interdisciplinary collaboration, with focus on how spatial and temporal information is represented across multiple modalities and fused representations and how this information is linked to musical constructs.

Thank you!
