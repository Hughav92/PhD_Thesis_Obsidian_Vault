# What I Worked On

- In the morning I worked on testing and debugging the Python object that I have written for [[IR Low Light Level Motion Analysis]] work. I then used this object to create some preliminary analysis plots and visualisations from a data exemplar.
- In the afternoon I worked on creating a presentation for the [[2024-11-19 Multimodal Signal Processing]] meeting tomorrow. There I will present some of the work that I have done for the [[IR Low Light Level Motion Analysis]].
