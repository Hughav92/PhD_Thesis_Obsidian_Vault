# Goals

- [ ] Start next models training for [[Multimodal Learning HAR]]
- [ ] Start working on a way to extract individual chair positions for [[IR Low Light Level Motion Analysis]]
- [ ] Get a working Scala install
- [x] Experiment with [[Thermography|thermal camera]]

# Tasks

- [x] Text development seminar
- [x] [MusicLab Brain: Inside the mind of a violinist](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/projects/musiclab/2024/brain/index.html)
- [x] Meeting about [[Thermography|thermal camera]]

# What I Worked On

- In the morning I attend the text development seminar at IMV. Thereafter I attended the MusicLab at the [Science Library](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/realfag/)
- In the afternoon, I met for a meeting about a [[Thermography|thermal camera]] that we had borrowed from the Department of Informatics that we can use for upcoming concert research.

# Reflections

- The [[Thermography|thermal camera]] is really promising, it can work as a form of automatic thresholding to isolate human activity within a frame. At the moment, I aim to use it simply to record [[Macromotion|macromotion]], and potentially use this for real-time motion analysis. However, I think that there is a lot of space to also look at [[Micromotion|micromotion]] in the future.
