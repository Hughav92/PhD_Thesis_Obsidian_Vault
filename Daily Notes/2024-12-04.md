# What I Worked On

- In the morning, I attended the [[2024-12-04 Multimodal Signal Processing|Multimodal Signal Processing]] group meeting.
- Directly after, I attended the [[2024-12-04 Winter Workshop - Presentation Skills|Winter Workshop: Presentation Skills]].
- After this ended I carried out some administrative work that needed to be caught up on after the workshops over the previous days. I also took an hour of reading time.

# Reflections

- The workshop provided some good feedback that I will take forward into future presentations. In particular, I will focus on the following three things:
	- Properly consider my vocal delivery, in particular volume and the use of pauses. In my opinion, I am too focused on the content that I will deliver, and ensuring that I am precise in what I intend to say. This leads to a lack of consideration of the audience's experience of the presentation.
	- Related to this, I will move away from working on scripts, instead working on some prepared segments that I can fall back on. I will then let the presentation grow organically to link these segments.
	- I will also focus less on terminology and instead more on content. I should still target the presentation towards the audience, and for example, if I am presenting to an academic audience I should employ the correct terminology, but I will focus less on ensuring exactitude and more on using terminology to support the content that I aim to convey. A colleague discussed previous advice that they had received from a professor, that longer term, audiences will not remember the exact words that you have used but rather just the overall impression of the work that you present.
