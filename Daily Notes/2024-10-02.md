# Goals

- [x] Make concrete plan for next steps on [[MoCap Latency Perception]] paper
- [x] Make a daily note template for Obsidian
- [ ] Finish reviewing [[Automatic Terminology Recognition Methods|ATR methods]] from [[@astrakhantsevATR4SToolkitStateart2018]]
- [ ] Add motivations to [[Spectrogram|spectrogram]] [[Accelerometer|accelerometer]] method developed for [[Multimodal Learning HAR]] paper
- [ ] Extract 3 second [[Spectrogram|spectrograms]] from [[UTH-MHAD]] dataset

# Tasks

- [x] Meet to discuss next plans for [[MoCap Latency Perception]] paper

# What I Worked On

- In the morning a meeting with Tejaswinee regarding progress on the [[MoCap Latency Perception]] paper. Developed a plan for moving forward for the next meeting. I will generate the humanoid stimuli from the [[BVH]] files and create the stimuli videos with masks.
- In the afternoon I got the daily notes up and running for the Obsidian vault and did some house keeping re. attribution of images, macros for tables etc. and answered outstanding emails.
- I worked on reviewing [[Automatic Terminology Recognition Methods|ATR methods]], in particular methods [[Automatic Terminology Recognition Methods#Methods Based on Reference Corpora|methods based upon reference corpora]] and [[Automatic Terminology Recognition Methods#Methods Based on Topic Modelling|methods based on topic modelling]]. In particular I tried to pick apart the [[i-SWB]] method in detail.

# Reflections

- I didn't get through all of my planned tasks for today. I will move these over to tomorrow.
- I feel that I am getting a little too deep into the weeds in terms of the [[Automatic Terminology Recognition Methods|ATR methods]]. I have basically finished reviewing the methods from [[@astrakhantsevATR4SToolkitStateart2018]] when I have finished writing up [[i-SWB]], so after this I will summarise the methods paper and then start evaluating the various methods available for the [[Multimodal Methods Systematic Review]] paper. I will also start collecting corpora.
