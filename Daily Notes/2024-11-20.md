# What I Worked On

- In the morning I setup a template for RITMO posters. I started working on the poster for the upcoming [RITMO Largo](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/news-and-events/events/conferences/2024/largo/).
- In the afternoon I attended the [[2024-11-20 Food and Paper|Food and Paper]] talk given by Palle Dahlstedt on using minimal algorithms in interactive music performance. I then had a [[2024-11-20 Career Development|career development]] meeting, followed by a [[2024-11-20 Meeting with Alexander|supervision meeting]].
- I finished preparing the poster for Largo.

# Reflections

- The aim of the Largo poster is to present ongoing work to guests who will attend the Largo, which is an open update on RITMO's research activities which will also be attended by members of the advisory board. As I am still at the beginning of the project, I have little in the way of results. I therefore decided to present the overall research questions and aims for my project, along with the plans for three of the subprojects that I am currently working on. The finalised poster looks like this:

I feel that there is a little too much text on the poster and not enough images. However, I haven't yet produced any nice eye-catching figures that I can use. On the whole, however, I am satisfied with the design.
