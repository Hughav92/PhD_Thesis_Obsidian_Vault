# Goals

- [x] Start reading papers for [[DCASE Checking]]
- [x] Work on [[Pure Data]] patch to receive [[Electromyography|EMG]] signals from [[SiFiBand]] without needing a Python bridge

# Tasks

# What I Worked On

- In the morning I started reading through papers required to double check the code that a colleague provided for their implementation of the DCASE winners over the previous years.
- In the afternoon, I attended a meeting to help in setting up the [[SiFiBand]] to work with the interactive system that we revived for the [[Diffracting the Preservation of Sonic Microinteraction with the SifiBand]] paper.

# Reflections

- The [[SiFiBand]] can stream data as a[[JSON]] directly to a udp address in an [[ASCII]] binary format. However [[Pure Data]] is not really built for parsing JSON, so it will be a little bit of work to actually extract the data.
