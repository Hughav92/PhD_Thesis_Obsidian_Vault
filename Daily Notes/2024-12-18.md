In Aarhus
# Goals

- [x] Communicate with the lighting desk and send it commands from my computer

# Tasks

- [x] [[2024-12-18 Aarhus Planning Meeting 5]]

# What I Worked On

- In the morning I travelled to Aarhus, to the Symphony Orchestra concert hall. We had a [[2024-12-18 Aarhus Planning Meeting 5|planning meeting]], and then familiarised ourselves with the concert hall and lighting system. I then setup in the lighting booth with the staff from ASO. We managed to control the lighting system using the Max patch and [[SiFiBand]], and took measurements to measure the system latency.

# Reflections

- Primarily I am happy that we managed to communicate with the lighting system in the concert hall from the Max patch. I was worried that this would be the biggest hurdle, but now that we now that this can work, we can focus more on the system design and conceptual elements of the interactive lighting system.
