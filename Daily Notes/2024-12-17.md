# What I Worked On

- Through out the day, I worked on finishing the Max patch for the Aarhus trip. This should be able to read an [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] csv file in "real-time" or receive a real-time [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] input, in this case from the [[SiFiBand]], and extract the [[RR-Peak|RR-peaks]] and [[Heart Rate|heart rate]]. I implemented this using the [[Pan-Tompkins Algorithm|Pan-Tompkins algorithm]] to extract the [[QRS Complex|QRS complex]]. The patch should then format this as an [[Open Sound Control|OSC]] message that can be sent to the lighting desk in the concert house.

# Reflections

- The Max patch works well enough, but it is still rather inefficient in some respects (e.g. in terms of the buffering of the ECG data which can cause slow-down at higher buffer sizes). However, it will work well enough for the Aarhus trip, and I can return to make improvements in the future.
