# Tasks

- [x] Attend midway evaluation

# What I Worked On

- In the morning I attended a midway evaluation that was taking place at IMV

# Reflections

- It was very useful to see the midway evaluation taking place. Although it is still quite a bit of time until I will have mine, it was already to good to get a little feel for how they proceed. It seemed not to be to adversarial, instead focusing on providing feedback on how to improve the work that had been presented. There were several tough questions though, and the presenter did have to defend quite a number of choices that they had made. I think the biggest challenge, however, might be the length of it. Having to be clear-headed, focused, and the centre of attention for 2 hours feel like it might potentially be quite exhausting mentally, especially to stay on top form throughout. So in that respect, speaking and answering questions at length is something that I need to practice.
