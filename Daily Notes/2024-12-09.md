# What I Worked On

- Throughout the day, I continued working on redrafting my project proposal to formalise the shifts in project aims, [[Research Question|research questions]], and background that have occurred over the previous several months.

# Reflections

- The project proposal updates are versions 11 and 12 of my proposal. These updates are probably the most major shift in orientation, however the proposal still possesses the same core as my original idea. A major shift is incorporating a wider theoretical background, drawing on methodological theorising from the fields of [[Multimodal Learning Analytics]] and [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning]]. I feel that it is now a lot more developed, and has a much stronger aim and research questions. Updating the proposal was not entirely necessary, but I feel that in view of the input and feedback that I have received in the first three months of the project, it is a good idea to formalise these developments in a new document around which I can orient myself.
