# What I Worked On

- Throughout the day, I continued working on redrafting my project proposal to formalise the shifts in project aims, [[Research Question|research questions]], and background that have occurred over the previous several months.

# Reflections

- The project proposal updates are versions 11 and 12 of my proposal. These updates are probably the most major shift in orientation, however the proposal still possesses the same core as my original idea
