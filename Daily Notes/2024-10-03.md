# Goals

- [x] Finish reviewing [[Automatic Terminology Recognition Methods|ATR methods]] from [[@astrakhantsevATR4SToolkitStateart2018]]
- [ ] Add motivations to [[Spectrogram|spectrogram]] [[Accelerometer|accelerometer]] method developed for [[Multimodal Learning HAR]] paper
- [ ] Extract 3 second [[Spectrogram|spectrograms]] from [[UTH-MHAD]] dataset

# Tasks

- [x] Meet with Kayla for [[BioArmband]] onboarding

# What I Worked On

- In the morning I worked on smoothing out some issues and tidying up the Obsidian vault. I improved the tagging of literature notes and citations within Obsidian (including that they present well in the online version), improved the daily note template and home page (adding for example the [[Homepage#What I'm Working On|"What I'm Working On"]] part), and put in place systems for manuscript writing in Obsidian.
- I finished reviewing the methods from [[@astrakhantsevATR4SToolkitStateart2018]] (in as far as I think that need them, there are still a few blank methods notes, but these are methods that I don't think I'll need). In particular, I finished the [[i-SWB]] and [[PU-ATR]] methods. I then wrote the literature note for [[@astrakhantsevATR4SToolkitStateart2018]].
- I looked into getting started with [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), as this is the language for which the main [[Automatic Terminology Recognition|ATR]] toolbox has been written.
- I made dedicated folders and notes for each of the papers that I am working on and tidied the ideas floating around a little.
- I organised and wrote some text for the [[Multimodal Methods Systematic Review|systematic review]] paper.
- I took part in the [[BioArmband]] onboarding.

# Reflections

- I have finished reviewing [[Automatic Terminology Recognition Methods|ATR methods]]. This is good, as I feel that I was getting a little too stuck in the methodological weeds, so to speak. I think that I have settled on using the [[PU-ATR]] method, incorporating several of the other methods such as [[Combo Basic Score]] and [[i-SWB]] as this was shown to work well by [[@astrakhantsevATR4SToolkitStateart2018]]. However, I still would like to read some more on how [[Automatic Terminology Recognition|ATR]] specifically has been used for scientific literature reviews and domain terminology extraction.
- I will now move into finding corpora of publication venues from which to scrape the literature. As a starting point, I think that I will start scraping literature from venues with which RITMO has published. This should be available through CRISTIN.
- The [[BioArmband]] looks very promising. A lot of work has been done since I tried the prototype last year. I think that there is a lot of potential to use this in Aarhus project. I want to try and get it to communicate with MAX.
- I didn't work on the goals associated with the [[Multimodal Learning HAR]] project. This is OK, as the we got an email today that the deadline tomorrow has been moved to next week, so this was planned. I will instead work on that either on the train or tomorrow. I'll preliminarily move the goals to tomorrow.
- Although I am involved in a number of projects, I feel that I am on top of things. I think that it helps a lot to stay organised here.
