>**Contribution**:: In this chapter, Stanley and Lehman discuss the constraints of framing AI research in terms of objectives and aims. They describe AI research as a form of "Meta-Search", i.e. that the field of AI research is concerned with developing algorithms that search and that the research is a form of searching for these. Through framing this in terms of evaluation metrics, large areas of the search space are ignored if the initial stepping stones do not show better results than the current state of the art. This is a particular problem in terms of peer-review, in which papers proposing novel algorithms that perform worse than the current state-of-the-art are rejected and are therefore not disseminated to the wider research community. The authors propose a novel form of peer-review, in which reviewers are not allowed to consider results in their decisions. Instead, they are only allowed to consider the novelty of the work.

> [!Abstract]
>
> This chapter provides a case study in how objectives can hold back progress in a particular field of scientific research. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) focuses on the ambitious aim of creating a human-level computer intelligence, an objective which is fascinating for the profound implications it entails if is ever achieved. Interestingly, viewing the dominant approaches to AI through the myth of the objective illustrates the insidious potential for objectives to deceive even scientific experts. In particular, AI research is guided by perceived progress towards the objective of human-level AI, and the criteria for publishing AI papers are themselves driven by performance and theoretical objectives. While on their surface these incentives seem to make sense, there’s no reason to suspect that the quest for AI is fundamentally different from other systems of innovation or achievement. Thus the chapter suggests non-objective criteria that might productively unseat traditional objective-based incentives in AI research.
