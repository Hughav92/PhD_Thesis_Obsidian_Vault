> Abstract
            Wearable sensors are widely used in medical applications and human–computer interaction because of their portability and powerful privacy. Human activity identification based on sensor data plays a vital role in these fields. Therefore, it is important to improve the recognition performance of different types of actions. Aiming at the problems of insufficient time-varying feature extraction and gradient explosion caused by too many network layers, a time convolution network recognition model with attention mechanism (TCN-Attention-HAR) was proposed. The model effectively recognizes and emphasizes the key feature information. The ability of extracting temporal features from TCN (temporal convolution network) is improved by using the appropriate size of the receiver domain. In addition, attention mechanisms are used to assign higher weights to important information, enabling models to learn and identify human activities more effectively. The performance of the Open Data Set (WISDM, PAMAP2 and USC-HAD) is improved by 1.13%, 1.83% and 0.51%, respectively, compared with other advanced models, these results clearly show that the network model presented in this paper has excellent recognition performance. In the knowledge distillation experiment, the parameters of student model are only about 0.1% of those of teacher model, and the accuracy of the model has been greatly improved, and in the WISDM data set, compared with the teacher's model, the accuracy is 0.14% higher.
