> The technical report presents our submission system for Task 3 of the DCASE 2024 Challenge: Audio and Audiovisual Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) with Source Distance Estimation (SDE). In addition to direction of arrival estimation (DOAE) of the sound source, this challenge also requires predicting the source distance. We attempted three methods to enable the system to predict both the DOA and the distance of the sound source. First, we proposed two multi-task learning frameworks. One introduces an extra branch to the original SELD model with multi-task learning framework, resulting in a three-branch output to simultaneously predict the DOA and distance of the sound source. The other integrates the sound source distance into the DOA prediction, estimat- ing the absolute position of the sound source. Second, we trained two models for DOAE and SDE respectively, and then used a joint prediction method based on the outputs of the two models. For the audiovisual SELD task with SDE, we used a ResNet-50 model pretrained on ImageNet as the visual feature extractor. Additionally, we simulated audio-visual data and used a teacher-student learning method to train our multi-modal system. We evaluated our methods on the dev-test set of the Sony-TAu Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2023 (STARSS23) dataset.
