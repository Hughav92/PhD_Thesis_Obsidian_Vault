> This technical report describes our submission system for the task 3 of the DCASE2022 challenge: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) Evaluated in Real Spatial Sound Scenes. Compared with the official baseline system, the improvements of our method mainly lie in three aspects: data augmentation, more powerful network architecture, and model ensemble. First, our previous work shows that the audio channel swapping (ACS) technique [1] can effectively deal with data sparsity problems in the SELD task, which is utilized in our method and provides an effective improvement with limited real training data. In addition, we generate multichannel recordings by using public datasets and perform data cleaning to drop bad data. Then, based on the augmented data, we employ a ResNet-Conformer architecture which can better model the context dependencies within an audio sequence. Specially, we found that time resolution had a significant impact on the model performance: with the time pooling layer moving back, the model can obtain a higher feature resolution and achieve better results. Finally, to attain robust performance, we employ model ensemble of different target representations (e.g., activity-coupled Cartesian direction of arrival (ACCDOA) and multi-ACCDOA) and post-processing strategies. The proposed system is evaluated on the dev-test set of Sony-TAu Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2022 (STARS2022) dataset.
