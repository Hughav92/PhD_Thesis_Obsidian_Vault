> The technical report details our submission system for Task 3 of the DCASE2023 Challenge: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) Evaluated in Real Spatial Sound Scenes. To address the audio-only SELD task, we apply the audio channel swapping (ACS) technique to generate augmented data, upon which a ResNet-Conformer architecture is employed as the acoustic model. Additionally, we introduce a class-dependent sound separation (SS) model to tackle overlapping mixtures and extract features from the SS model as prompts to perform SELD for a specific event class. In the case of audio-visual SELD task, we leverage object detection and human body key point detection algorithms to identify potential sound events and extract Gaussian-like vectors, which are subsequently concatenated with acoustic features as the input. Moreover, we propose a video data augmentation method based on the ACS method of audio data. Finally, we present a post-processing strategy to enhance the results of audio-only SELD models with the location information predicted by video data. We evaluate our approach on the dev-test set of the Sony-TAu Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2023 (STARSS23) dataset.
