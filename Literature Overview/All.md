This is achieved through the use of a [[Temporal Convolutional Network\|TCN]], which is passed a [[Multimodality\|multimodal]] feature vector consisting of extracted bone vectors from the [[Digital Video Signal\|video]] and [[Mel Spectrogram\|mel spectrogram]] for the corresponding frame from the [[Digital Audio Signal\|audio]]. The model performed with an [[F1-Score]] of 0.797, which the authors claim shows an accuracy of approximately 80%. However, the model performed a lot better on certain genres and classes of dance video than others. Through an [[Ablation Study\|ablation study]], they show that the [[Multimodal Machine Learning\|multimodal modal]] performs [[Statistical Significance\|statistically significantly]] better than the audio or video model alone. In addition they prepare a subset of the [[AIST Dance Video Database]] [[@tsuchidaAISTDanceVideo2019]] with annotations of the segmentation points between individual dance moves, as annotated by 21 annotators including the first author. Finally, they contribute a standalone application that annotates an imported video, although at time of writing, this has not yet been made publicly available. |

In addition, this paper contributes a [Scala toolbox](https://github.com/ispras/atr4s) which implements 15 of these methods. Finally the authors evaluate theses methods in their implementation, and find that [[PU-ATR]] performs best for small datasets and corpora in cases where time complexity is not an issue, [[Basic Score]] or [[Combo Basic Score]] perform best for large datasets, and [[Key Concept Relatedness]] performs best for tasks requiring the recognition of few terms for domains well covered by Wikipedia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

They describe AI research as a form of "Meta-Search", i.e. that the field of AI research is concerned with developing algorithms that search and that the research is a form of searching for these. Through framing this in terms of evaluation metrics, large areas of the search space are ignored if the initial stepping stones do not show better results than the current state of the art. This is a particular problem in terms of peer-review, in which papers proposing novel algorithms that perform worse than the current state-of-the-art are rejected and are therefore not disseminated to the wider research community. The authors propose a novel form of peer-review, in which reviewers are not allowed to consider results in their decisions. Instead, they are only allowed to consider the novelty of the work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
