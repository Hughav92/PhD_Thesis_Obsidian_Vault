# **Previous Meeting**

Previous meeting on [[Meeting with Alexander 2024.09.18|18.09.2024]]

# **To Discuss:**

- Paper idea - "Whose Time is it Anyway?". Looking at the synchronisation and alignment of multiple data modalities. When we synchronise and/or align multiple time-series signals, what are the underlying assumptions we are making about the temporality of the event? How does this relate to the spatial characteristics of the sensor placement and recording space? How does this relate to the human perception of the event? And how does this influence the analysis of the data?
- Open-sourcing of the thesis writing on GitHub. Attempt at [[Open Science|open science]]. Not just sharing results and data, but also the process of research. Can share this Obsidian vault through GitHub integration.
