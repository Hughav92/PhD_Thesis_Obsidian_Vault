# Previous Meeting

Previous meeting on [[Meeting with Alexander 2024.09.05|05.09.2024]]

# **To discuss**

1. IPED conference paper acceptance dates
2. Reframing of review (and thesis) towards musicking dataset instead of music datasets.
3. Difficulty in review methodology: systematic review methodology in musicology, cross-disciplinary terminology, review not of study aims so not in abstract/title

# **Notes**

Document process - as this important for methodology
Not end up in paper but in dissertation

# **Minutes**

1. I explained my process regarding the [[Method|method]] and [[Methodology|methodology]] for the systematic review, based upon entire publication venue corpora and [[Combo Basic Score|combo basic scores]]. Alexander thought that this sounded fine and that I should proceed. He recommended that I start documenting this process now, both in terms of the method that I will use, as well as methodological considerations relating to this (these are available in [[Method|Systematic Review Paper/Methods/Method]] and [[Methodology|Systematic Review Paper/Methods/Methodology]]). Alexander also advised that much of the methodological considerations might not need to or be able to be fit into the article, but that this is valuable text for the dissertation itself. #methods #methodology
