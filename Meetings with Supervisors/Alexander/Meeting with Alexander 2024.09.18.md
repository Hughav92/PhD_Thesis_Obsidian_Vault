# **Notes**

- Paradata - Describes context, professor from Upsala, required to understand the whole of the data, maybe data management plan as part of paradata, think about in terms of higher level considerations, interesting publication - importance of being there or not being there (assumption etc.).
- Strength of RITMO, same data with multiple data. Devices describing the same thing, how do they compare? Different measurements reflect the same reality in the same way, something interesting to say. Maybe go across all datasets and collect quantity of motion and compare to sound. What other things could work across all datasets. Some times helps to zoom out and look at whole picture. Can you detect what's going on based just upon QOM and audio energy? What type of overarching tools? Metadata? What can you do better?
- Paper "the best versus good enough practices" Alexander
- Conceptual Framework - world is a mess, try to do the best that we can, and that's what it is - Framework to handle messiness! Practices and ways of working that will improve the situation
- Audio/Video as strategy for addressing other data modalities, perhaps all that is in common
- Time/Effort investment should reflect where end up in author list - think about end product. Don't do anything without thinking how this could end up in a publication. Clarity early on.

# **Minutes**

- We first discussed the concept of [[Paradata|paradata]]. This is a concept attributed to [[Couper_1998_Measuring survey quality in a CASIC environment.pdf|Couper (1998)]] which refers to the procedural and environmental context surrounding the collection of [[Data|data]], as opposed to [[Metadata|metadata]], which is information that describes the data itself. Alexander made reference to a professor from Upsala (who I should look into), who, for example, talked about the data management plan being an important piece of paradata. Alexander mention that there might be an interesting publication in thinking about the higher level considerations related to paradata, and also the importance of being present or not being present during a data collection. In other words having direct experience of the phenomenon that the data is representing or not. I talked about this in relation to my experience of working on the Danish String Quartet [[Motion Capture|mocap]] data, where I became almost intimately familiar with the performers through their motion. However, when I finally viewed videos and images of the event, the performers and the performance environment did not at all align with the mental image that I had created. #paradata #metadata #presence
- We discussed that one of the major strengths of the [[RITMO Datasets|RITMO datasets]] is that there are many examples of the same underlying phenomenon and [[Physical Quantity|physical quantities]] measured using different [[Sensor|sensors]]. These different methods of measurement reflect the same physical reality in different ways. For example, there are many datasets which obtain data on human body motion using [[RGB Camera|RGB cameras]], [[Accelerometer|accelerometers]], and [[Optical Marker-Based Motion Capture|marker-based motion capture]]. Perhaps I could look across these datasets and compare the results of common analysis methods (e.g. the [[Quantity of Motion|quantity of motion]]). Maybe we start sketching out methods that could be applied across all datasets. For example, is there a common thread that the [[Quantity of Motion|quantity of motion]] correlates with the [[Root Mean Square|root mean square]] of the audio signals across all of the datasets? #dataset #sensor #analysis #data #quantity-of-motion #root-mean-square
- Alexander wrote a paper on best versus good enough practices in music research. I should take a look at this in relation to methodological reflection. #best-practice #good-enough-practice
- The conceptual framework that I am developing as part of this project should not attempt to be all encompassing, or as put by Alexander, I should not try to develop "one framework to rule them all". Instead, this should be a conceptual tool to handle the messiness of the world, to help navigate through analytical practice. #framework
- Perhaps audiovisual data could serve as a unifying thread to help navigate through the datasets. Most datasets contain at least an audio recording and a video recording, so these could serve as an axis upon which to centre discussion of other data modalities. However, I stressed that I didn't want this thesis to end up as a thesis on audiovisual analysis. For me it is important to give equal weight to other potential data modalities, as I think that there is still a lot to be said about other, less common data modalities without subsuming this into a discussion of audiovisual data. #modality #audio #video
