The aim of the Largo poster is to present ongoing work to guests who will attend the Largo, which is an open update on RITMO's research activities which will also be attended by members of the advisory board. As I am still at the beginning of the project, I have little in the way of results. I therefore decided to present the overall research questions and aims for my project, along with the plans for three of the subprojects that I am currently working on.
