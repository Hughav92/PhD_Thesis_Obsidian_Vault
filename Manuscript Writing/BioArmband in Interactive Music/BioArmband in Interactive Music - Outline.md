# Introduction

Introduce context for IMU/EMG portable systems in interactive music and research contexts. Explain that Myo used a lot, but that is no out of production. Frame BioArmband as lineage with Myo. It is also important to evaluate the relationship between the two devices while it is still possible (Myos aren't all dead)

# Background and Related Work

Short review of works using EMG/IMU in interactive music performance and research, especially those using Myo.

# Methods

Three categories of devices:

1. Myo
2. BioArmband
3. Qualisys/Delsys

Three broad categories of evaluation:

## Technical Evaluation

1. Latency
2. Jitter
3. Noise

Use Qualisys and Delsys as measurement tools for IMU and EMG.

## Interactive Music Based Tasks

We fill follow a framework of sound-action typologies. One impulsive action, one iterative action and one sustained action.

1. Impulsive - Hit a snare drum with a dumstick
2. Iterative - Repeatedly run a scale on a piano
3. Sustained - Bowing on saw

A simple sonification for each of these.
