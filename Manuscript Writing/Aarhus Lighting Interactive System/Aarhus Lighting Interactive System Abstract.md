Abstract drafts for [[Aarhus Lighting Interactive System]]
# Draft 1

In May 2025 we will undertake a large scale data collection with the Aarhus Symphony Orchestra (ASO) consisting of various sensor measurements from both musicians and audiences. As part of this project, we intend to implement a real-time mapping of physiological signals acquired from performers and motion information extracted from infra-red and thermal imaging of the audience to various parameters of the stage-light system installed in the concert house, with the aim that this support audience understanding of the musical structure and emotional content of the performed works. In this paper, we outline the preparatory work performed during and after a preliminary visit to the concert house. This consists of an account of the system design, the theoretical underpinnings of the multimodal mapping strategies, an evaluation of system latency, and challenges in integrating interactive elements into a large, installed system. We frame this in relation to theoretical perspectives on integrating interactive elements into pre-existing musical works in order to support audience understanding. Additionally, we outline future work that will take place in preparation for the upcoming concert series.
