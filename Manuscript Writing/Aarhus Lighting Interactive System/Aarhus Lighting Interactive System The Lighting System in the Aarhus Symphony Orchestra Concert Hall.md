The Aarhus Symphony Orchestra concert hall (Figure 1) is rigged with a total of 230 individually programmable lights. From these, we are primarily working with a subset of 80 LEDs. These can be further subdivided into three groups. The first are the 36 baluster LEDs, mounted along the audience balconies. By increasing the intensity of these LEDs with a slight delay, for example, it is possible to simulate a wave passing through the audience. The second group are the 16 background LEDs. These are mounted at stage level on a small wall directly behind the orchestra and below the organ. The third group are the 28 organ LEDs mounted within the organ pipes in two rows. Combining these with gobo spotlights, it is possible to project images onto the organ (Figure 2). The baluster and background groups consist of RGBW LEDs, while the organ group are just RGB. The lighting plan for the concert hall can be seen in Figure 2.
