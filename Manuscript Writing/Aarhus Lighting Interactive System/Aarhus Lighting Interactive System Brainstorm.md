# Main Contribution

- Proposal of mapping strategies of physiological signals to stage lighting systems to aid in music understanding for symphonic performance
- Implementation and preliminary evaluation of mapping ECG to lighting system in house
- Pan-Tompkins for Max
# Outline

## [[Aarhus Lighting Interactive System Introduction|Introduction]] (200)

- Broad framing: Symphonic concert large-scale musicking
	- However, little work done on interactivity
- What we are doing: Part of research series on live concert research
	- May 2025 multiple days of concerts for data collection
	- Implementation of interactive elements in particular mapping to lighting system to aid in understanding
	- We collect multiple signals - list
	- In this paper present preliminary work from single day visit
	- In particular:
		- Present prelim work from single day visit
		- Focus on ECG/HR
		- Present system design, implementation, preliminary technical evaluation

### [[Aarhus Lighting Interactive System Background#Interactive Systems in Orchestral Settings|Interactive Systems in Orchestral Settings]] (100)

- Hyper-instruments - orchestral
- New instruments which are used in orchestral performance - e.g. Halduraphone
- Systems which integrate into orchestral performance - e.g. Verdugo et al 2022
### Music Understanding (100)


### Sensor to Lighting Mapping in Interactive Systems (100)


## System Overview (400)

- Focus on heart-rate here
- Simple mapping of Heart-beat to lighting pulse as test
- Constraints (e.g. what can we work with)
