# Main Contribution

- Proposal of mapping strategies of physiological signals to stage lighting systems to aid in music understanding for symphonic performance
- Implementation and preliminary evaluation of mapping ECG to lighting system in house
- Pan-Tompkins for Max
# Outline

## Introduction (200)

- Broad framing: Symphonic concert large-scale musicking
	- However, little work done on interactivity
- What we are doing: Part of research series on live concert research
	- May 2025 multiple days of concerts for data collection
	- Implementation of interactive elements in particular mapping to lighting system to aid in understanding
	- We collect multiple signals - list
	- In this paper present preliminary work from single day visit
	- In particular:
		- Present prelim work from single day visit
		- Focus on ECG/HR
		- Present system design, implementation, preliminary technical evaluation

## Background (300)

### Interactive Systems in Orchestral Settings


### Music Understanding


### Sensor to Lighting Mapping in Interactive Systems


## System (400)

- Focus on heart-rate here
- Simple mapping of Heart-beat to lighting pulse as test

### Design


### Implementation


## Preliminary Technical Evaluation (600)

### Heart-Rate Extraction Accuracy

#### Method

- Validate against Equivital

#### Results
### System Latency
#### Method
##### Sensor to Max

- Wear Equivital and Bio-Armband
	- Compare Timestamps

##### HR Extraction


##### Max to lights

- Video analysis

#### Results
