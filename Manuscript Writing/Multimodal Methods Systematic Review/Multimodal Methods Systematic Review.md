# Abstract (Draft 1)
Analytical methods based upon the simultaneous or joint analysis of multiple [[Data Modality|data modalities]] are found across a range of disciplines concerned with extracting [[Information|information]][^1] from [[Music Datasets vs Musicking Datasets|musicking datasets]]. However, the exact methods employed, as well as the methodological frameworks from which these methods have developed, vary greatly across these disciplines. This leads to differing traditions in aspects such as terminology, the processing and treatment of data, as well as more broad issues such as what counts or does not count as a data modality. In this paper, we employ a [[Text Mining|text mining]] approach with [[Automatic Terminology Recognition|automatic terminology recognition]] methods to review corpora of literature across several musicological and adjacent disciplines resulting in a systematic overview of analytical methods used for multimodal analysis. We formalise this overview in a methodological framework for the analysis of multimodal musicking datasets, grounding this framework in a theoretical perspective of [[Data Fusion|data fusion]]. We identify emerging [[Cross-Disciplinarity|cross-disciplinary]] methodological trends and suggest future directions of methodological development.
