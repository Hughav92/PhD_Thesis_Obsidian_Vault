# **Systematic Reviews**

A common method for performing a systematic review is to define several query terms, query databases such as [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) in order to obtain a corpus of potential texts to include in the review. Then the title and abstract of each paper are screened according to a pre-defined inclusion criteria in order to build a corpus of relevant texts to review. I should add some references regarding this method. A colleague referred to this method as a "subtractive-synthesis" literature review, in contrast to an "additive synthesis" review which involves following chains of references from an initial reference. I like this idea. However, there are several challenges involved in performing such a review in the context that I intend to, in which the review's [[Objectives - Multimodal Methods Systematic Review|objectives]] and [[Research Questions - Multimodal Methods Systematic Review|research questions]] are not necessarily aligned with the review corpus' objectives and [[Research Question|research questions]]. Additional challenges are also posed due to the [[Cross-Disciplinarity|cross-disciplinary]] nature of the review. #systematic-review #cross-disciplinary #subtractive-synthesis #additive-synthesis 

# **Cross-Disciplinary Reviewing**

A key challenge in the current review is that the aim of this review is not necessarily aligned with the [[Research Question|research questions]], results, or overall objectives of the studies under review. As this review aims to review  [[Methods vs Methodology|methods and methodological approaches]] employed by the studies, key information and search terms which highlight the relevance of the study to the review might not be present in the study title or abstract. Moreover, as key terminology might differ between the disciplines being reviewed, as wider net must be cast in order to ensure that relevant studies across all disciplines are caught. #systematic-review #review #title #abstract #terminology

As noted by [[@omara-evesTechniquesIdentifyingCrossdisciplinary2013]] performing a [[Cross-Disciplinarity|cross-disciplinary]], systematic review can pose a particular challenge due to the difficulty in forming relevant search terms from keywords which might vary greatly across disciplines, even if the phenomenon that the keywords relate to might be similar or even identical. In addition, they note that the research questions posed within individual disciplines might not necessarily align with the research questions of the cross-disciplinary review, meaning that potentially relevant papers might be excluded upon screening post search due to the absence of the researcher's keywords from the title and abstract. The authors propose a [[Text Mining|text mining]] approach, performing a pre-screening of related reviews and performing automated [[Text Mining|text mining]] to identify additional keywords that can be added to the researcher's search terms, reporting that their approach lead to the identification of 28.5% of the studies in their review of *community engagement interventions* across fields as diverse as economics, psychology, and social policy that would not have been identified using more traditional methods. The method that they use for their [[Text Mining|text mining]] is the calculation of [[Contextual Value (C-Value)|c-values]], however in the time since publication several newer and more comprehensive methods have been developed such as the [[Basic Score|basic score]] and the [[Combo Basic Score|combo basic score]], as detailed by [[@astrakhantsevATR4SToolkitStateart2018]]  #cross-disciplinary #systematic-review #review #research-question #title #abstract #text-mining
